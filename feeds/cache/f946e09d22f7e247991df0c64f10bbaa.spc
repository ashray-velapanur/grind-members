So why do we chronically underestimate the time and energy that we need to dedicate to this crucial task?</span>Creative business owners frequently minimize the importance of hiring. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;tertiary task&rdquo; superficially unrelated to client work, and often triggered under duress: a huge new client project to ramp up for, the opening of a new office, or the exodus of a few great employees. For this reason, hiring often takes on a stressful tone and is executed hastily. Yet no decision can have a bigger impact on the direction of your work and the long-term success of your business.<br /><br />Hiring exceptional people allows a leader to set strategic direction and then hand over incremental decisions to smart, capable team members. In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162"><em>Linchpin</em></a>, Seth Godin uses the example of the fast and complex Japanese transit system, which operates on-schedule and on-budget, not by top-down directive, but by a large pool of empowered employees making the best decisions in the moment. &ldquo;Letting people in the organization use their judgment turns out to be faster and cheaper - but only if you hire the right people and reward them for having the right attitude.&rdquo;<br /><br />The trick is uncovering those talented and trustworthy people - and knowing what they look like when you find them. Here are a handful of tips:<br /><br /><strong>1. You cannot clone yourself. </strong>One of the first obstacles in expanding a creative operation is rewiring your brain. Subconsciously or not, you may be fixated on looking for someone with the skills, mannerisms, single-minded passion, and other useful qualities that mimic your own. Instead, look for a cocktail of complementary skills to balance your weaknesses. Seek a foundation of rudiments and a likeable and hard-working personality. There is no one who loves your work more than you. <br /><br /><strong>2. Persistence is golden. </strong>There&rsquo;s a rule of thumb called The Rule of 100. Assume you&rsquo;ll need to make contact with 100 people in order to find 10 prospects to narrow to a pool of 3 great matches. Sometimes this is an overestimation, but the point is that finding the right person is usually a matter of persistence. Don&rsquo;t stop looking if you&rsquo;re having trouble finding the right fit, just keep looking.<br /><br /><strong>3. The best resource is your personal network. </strong>Hands down the best source for locating a person that fits you and your company is your circle of contacts. It&rsquo;s your job to communicate effectively to your network by being clear about what you&rsquo;re looking for and the context of the hire. It helps to be specific when approaching your network to give them information that&rsquo;s easy to act on.<br /><br /><strong>4. But&hellip; don&rsquo;t forget to look beyond your network.</strong> It is a common strategy (and a common mistake) to stick to your personal network to find quality people. Go beyond your circle of contacts. Make a list of people and companies you respect or admire and reach out to them for assistance. Always ask who you should speak to next to continue to expand your network concentrically outward. <br /><br /><strong>5. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior... but it&rsquo;s not always obvious. </strong>Often a person&rsquo;s interests are found in the seams of their resume or professional trajectory. Find out about hobbies, art projects or groups they started outside of work. This type of initiative will provide insight into how well a person works independently and if they&rsquo;re prone to turning ideas action.<br /><br /><strong>6. Use &ldquo;critical incident interviewing.&rdquo; </strong>This is an interview model that queries specific past events as a basis for discerning a person&rsquo;s capabilities. It&rsquo;s all about cascading questions. Start by asking about an incident, then peeling back the layers to evaluate the person&rsquo;s thought process, judgment, and how he or she deals with a situation. <br /><br />For example:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Tell me about a time you disagreed with your supervisor on a creative issue.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Walk me through the problem.&rdquo;&ldquo;What did you do about it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What led to that decision?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why do you think that was effective?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What was the outcome?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br /><strong>7. Assign homework. </strong>After a series of interviews, it is common practice for companies to assign a phantom project or problem to solve. Some even hand off a client assignment and compensate potential employees for their work. There&rsquo;s no better way to predict performance than by having the opportunity to evaluate the work directly and get a feel for a prospect&rsquo;s style and habits.<br /><br /><strong>8. Do great work and make great stuff... so the best people find you. </strong>It&rsquo;s no surprise that the best companies always have the easiest time hiring. That&rsquo;s because people are clamoring to work for them. Strive to do mind-bendingly great work and the hiring will take care of itself!<br /><br />--<br /><strong>What&rsquo;s Your Experience?</strong></div>

Over the years I've heard this statement - or versions of it - from many different managers charged with getting creative work out of their teams. </span>From a conventional management perspective, it probably sounds like common sense. But to anyone who understands the nature of creativity and what motivates creative people, it's a recipe for disaster. <br /><br />Rewarding people for hard work is a great thing to do, but it's no guarantee of loyalty - and certainly no guarantee of creativity. And using rewards as an incentive - or even a threat - has been proven not to work when it comes to complex, challenging, creative work.<br /><br />There is a large body of research evidence - from the work of Harvard Business Professor Theresa Amabile and others - that relying on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wishfulthinking.co.uk/2008/11/10/rewards-for-work/">extrinsic motivations</a> (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) has a negative impact on creativity. While it may seem obvious that the stick has a negative impact on creativity, it's counterintuitive that the carrot has the same effect. <br /><br />But when you're focused on a reward, you're not focused on the work itself. And as any creative will tell you, doing outstanding creative work - whether solving a technical problem or creating a work of art - requires 100% focus on the task in hand, to the point of obsession. You have to love what you do. <br /><br />Of course companies need to pay people well. If they don't, compensation becomes a bone of contention, and a distraction from their work. But if you really want outstanding creative performance, you need people to focus on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wishfulthinking.co.uk/2008/11/03/motivating-creative-people-the-joy-of-work/">intrinsic motivations</a> - factors inherent in the work itself. Things like challenge, interest, learning, meaning, freedom, and creative flow. They are what really motivates creative people - and the research demonstrates a strong link between levels of intrinsic motivation and creativity.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In <em>The Rise of the Creative Class</em>, Richard Florida discusses the results of an Information Week survey of 20,000 IT workers, who were asked "What matters most to you about your job?". Florida points out that not only did money (an extrinsic motivation) rank only fourth, behind three different types of intrinsic motivation, but that "nine of the ten highly valued job factors are intrinsic". And remember, it was a survey of IT workers, who might be expected to take a more hard-nosed approach to motivation than more artistic types.<br /><br />So the nature of creativity and the inclinations of creative workers presents a challenge, both for managers and the workers themselves. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You Can't Buy Creativity - You Have to Inspire It</strong></span><br /><br />If you're a leader or manager, how do you attract top creative talent and get the best from them? <br /><br />To some extent it's an organizational issue - allowing people to work in smaller units with greater autonomy is more conducive to creativity than in large corporate departments with centralized control.<br /><br />But it's also about the relationships between leaders and teams, and among peers - how the challenge is framed, what managers say to their teams, and how team members support, encourage, and challenge each other.<br /><br />Money buys you people's time. It should also guarantee you basic professional competence. But you don't get outstanding creativity by simply offering more money. You get mercenaries. <br /><br />If you want real creativity - the magic ingredient X that sets the product apart - you need to inspire it, by showing them what makes the work fascinating, challenging, meaningful, and fun. And you need to give them freedom to do it their way, rather than micro-managing every step.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to Keep Your Creative Spark Alight</strong></span><br /><br />If you're a creative, you probably experience a tension between following your own creative inclinations vs giving the market (your boss, clients, or customers) what it wants. Spend too much time on your own pet projects and you risk disappointing the VIPs in your working life. But if you spend too much time on well-paid work that doesn't inspire you, you're creativity will fade away.<br /><br />So it's vital to strike a balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in the work you take on. Sometimes you need to take on a less glamorous project or job to pay the bills - if so, make time for more interesting creative pursuits, in the evenings and weekends if need be. This will keep your creative spark alive and make you less resentful of the grunt work.<br /><br />And challenge yourself to take a creative approach to any job you take on, no matter how unpromising the brief. It could be as mundane as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidairey.com/elastic-band-packaging/">packaging elastic bands</a>, but if you keep coming up with original and valuable solutions, you'll earn a reputation for priceless creativity.<br /><br />--</div>

A quick sampling of her lines in <em>Gone With the Wind</em> yields: "I can't think about that right now. If I do, I'll go crazy." And, "I'll think about it tomorrow, when I can stand it."&nbsp;And, of course, her famous closing line: "After all... tomorrow is another day!"</div>
<div>It turns out that O'Hara was a bit of a trailblazer in the "I'll-do-it-tomorrow" category. In a landmark study of procrastination completed just a few years ago the news was not good. Our collective habit of putting things off is getting worse. While in the 1970s, only about 5% of Americans admitted to regularly procrastinating, today it's a whopping 26%.</div>
<div><br />Few of us are strangers to the malingering to-do list item - typically a difficult or complex activity - that we&nbsp;just can't seem to get motivated for today. "I'll take care of that tomorrow," we say, O'Hara-style. Yet when tomorrow comes around, we often come to the same conclusion again, and again.<br /><br />As James&nbsp;Surowiecki explains in an excellent&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=1"><em>New Yorker</em>&nbsp;article on procrastination</a>:&nbsp;"Our memory for the intensity of visceral rewards is deficient: when we put off preparing for that meeting by telling ourselves that we&rsquo;ll do it tomorrow, we fail to take into account that tomorrow the temptation to put off work will be just as strong." When tomorrow becomes today, our perspective changes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Only about 5% of Americans admitted to regularly procrastinating in the 1970s, today it's a whopping 26%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The question, then, is: How&nbsp;can we recalibrate - or just plain trick - our psyches and our selves into mustering up the right mixture of self-discipline and external motivators to take action sooner rather than later?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few suggestions for overcoming procrastination:<br /><br /><strong>1. View deadlines as a way to create a window of opportunity.</strong><br />The default take on deadlines is typically to consider them to be cumbersome and stressful. Yet, from another perspective,&nbsp;a deadline can be viewed as a huge benefit to any project. Without the urgency of a hard deadline pushing a project to completion, it&rsquo;s easy for you, your team, or your client to lose focus. We&rsquo;ve all worked on agonizing projects where the timeline just bleeds on and on, merely because the flexibility is there.</div>
<div><br />As illustrator Christoph Niemann pointed out in a <a target="_blank" href="http://the99percent.com/articles/6003/Christoph-Niemann-Short-Deadlines-Make-You-Think-Straight">99% interview</a>,&nbsp;deadlines can actually help&nbsp;us by creating a fixed window of opportunity that requires us to be focused, pragmatic, and decisive:</div>
<div><br /><span class="pullquote">In advertising, and also editorial, when people have 2 days, the briefing is much better, and the discussion is much better. It&rsquo;s not that people just sign off on anything because they&rsquo;re in a hurry. They&rsquo;re just really looking at what they have, and trying to make the best product, and get it done.<br /><br />The problem is when people have too much time on their hands. Because then at some point everybody&rsquo;s going to question, &ldquo;Why did you make it red, not green?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Could we try it upside-down, or left to right?&rdquo; and then at some point it becomes arbitrary.<br /><br />If the anxiety is about the deadline, then the energy really focuses on the result. If there is not anxiety about a deadline, all of the anxiety goes right to the creative part.</span></div>
<div><br /><strong>2. Create accountability (and fear!).</strong><br />In the documentary <a target="_blank" href="http://conanobriencantstop.com/"><em>Conan O'Brien Can't Stop</em></a>, we see the late night talk show host struggling with idleness and unemployment after he's booted from NBC. To get his groove back, O'Brien decides to put together a tour across America. When tickets go on sale, the team is stressed: No one knows what will happen. When it sells out in a matter of hours, they're thrilled. But after the flush of success wears off, O&rsquo;Brien has his &ldquo;Oh, shit!&rdquo; realization: Now he has to actually figure out what he&rsquo;s going to do.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pullquote">"Nothing motivates you to figure out what your show is like selling a bunch of tickets," O'Brien explains.</div>
<div><br />While most of us may not have the adoring audience that Conan O'Brien does, but we can all muster up someone&nbsp;to hold us accountable:&nbsp;Whether it's declaring your intentions publicly to your team of colleagues, taking on a paid assignment you&nbsp;have&nbsp;to deliver, or just telling a family member or friend who's willing to nag you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>No one wants to disappoint an expectant audience. By creating one, you light a fire under your ass.</div>
<div><br /><strong>3. Break the project down into smaller concrete tasks.</strong><br />It turns out that the manner in which a task is presented to someone - or the way in which you present it to your brain - has a significant impact on how motivated you will be to take action. A study led by researcher Sean McCrea at the University of Konstanz in Germany recently found that people are much more likely to tackle a concrete task than an abstract task. Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/node/12971028?story_id=12971028">recap from <em>The Economist</em></a>:<br /><br /><span class="pullquote">Dr McCrea and his colleagues conducted three separate studies. First they recruited 34 students who were offered &euro;2.50 ($3.30) for completing a questionnaire within the subsequent three weeks. Half of the students were then sent an email asking them to write a couple of sentences on how they might go about various activities, such as opening a bank account or keeping a diary. The others were asked to write about why someone might want to open a bank account or keep a diary.<br /><br />For their second study, Dr McCrea and his colleagues recruited 50 students, who were offered the same sums and timespans as the first lot. Half of these students were asked to provide examples of members of a group, for example, naming any type of bird. The task was inverted for the other students, who were asked to name a category to which birds belong.<br />...<br /><br />Those who were presented with concrete tasks and information responded more promptly than did those who were asked to think in an abstract way. Moreover, almost all the students who had been prompted to think in concrete terms completed their tasks by the deadline while up to 56% of students asked to think in abstract terms failed to respond at all.</span></div>
<div><br />It seems to me like the difference between being handed a map versus following the step-by-step instructions of a GPS device. Not everyone can read a map, but everyone can follow the directions. By breaking your project down into smaller, well-described tasks, the way forward becomes clear and it's easy to take action.</div>
<div><br /><strong>4. Work on the project a little bit each day.</strong><br />A few weeks ago on Father&rsquo;s Day, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/06/subconscious-information-processing.html">Fred Wilson did a nice post</a> about why working on a problem over time is superior to churning something out just before a deadline. Here&rsquo;s the advice his father shared with Fred when he got caught procrastinating:<br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="pullquote">He explained that I should start working on a project as soon as it was assigned. An hour or so would do fine, he told me. He told me to come back to the project every day for at least a little bit and make progress on it slowly over time. I asked him why that was better than cramming at the very end (as I was doing during the conversation).<br /><br />He explained that once your brain starts working on a problem, it doesn't stop. If you get your mind wrapped around a problem with a fair bit of time left to solve it, the brain will solve the problem subconsciously over time and one day you'll sit down to do some more work on it and the answer will be right in front of you.</span></div>
<div><br />Most of our greatest insights - those fabled "A-ha!" moments - arrive when we least expect them. To use computer terms, they come when our brains are processing problems "in the background" of our consciousness - while we&rsquo;re running, or showering, or sleeping. If we start projects at the 11th hour and cram, cram, cram till deadline, there's no allowance for the vital "<a target="_blank" href="http://the99percent.com/articles/6947/What-Happened-to-Downtime-The-Extinction-of-Deep-Thinking-Sacred-Space">downtime</a>" that fuels our best creative insights.</div>

We have to go to work each day and deliver consistently brilliant work, on demand, in order to keep our jobs. And though we relish getting to do what we love and earning a living at it, over time our passion and energy can wane if we&rsquo;re only creating to earn a paycheck.</span>In her classic book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theartistsway.com/"><em>The Artist&rsquo;s Way</em></a>, creativity expert Julia Cameron shares a practice she stumbled upon while living in New Mexico and recovering from yet another in a series of career disasters. Every morning, she writes out three pages, longhand, of pure stream of consciousness.<br /><br />In describing her method for &ldquo;Morning Pages,&rdquo; Cameron says there is no need for editing or structuring the content. The entire purpose of the exercise is to get the brain moving and to circumvent any potential barriers to creative breakthroughs. &ldquo;When people ask, &lsquo;Why do we write morning pages?&rsquo; I joke, &lsquo;To get to the other side,&rsquo;&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;They think I am kidding, but I&rsquo;m not. Morning pages do get us to the other side: the other side of our fear, of our negativity, of our moods. Above all they get us beyond our Censor.&rdquo;<br /><br />What Cameron is advocating through the practice of Morning Pages is the act<br />of &ldquo;Unnecessary Creating.&rdquo; That is, creating for ourselves rather than for others.<br /><br /><strong>A few key qualities of Unnecessary Creation:</strong><br /> 
<ul>
<li>You set your own agenda.</li>
<li>You have permission to try new things and develop new skills.</li>
<li>You can take as much or as little time as you need to get it right.</li>
<li>You can stretch yourself, explore fringe ideas that intimidate you, and make things that no one but you will ever see.</li>
<li>If you fail, it&rsquo;s no big deal.</li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Why Is Unnecessary Creation So Important?</strong><br /><br />When we spend all of our time and energy creating on-demand, it&rsquo;s easy to lose touch with the passions that fuel our best work. We grow used to leveraging our abilities for the sole purpose of meeting others&rsquo; expectations rather than exploring new possibilities and taking risks. We may even experience a backup of ideas and thoughts, or feel like we&rsquo;re subverting our own life and passions for the sake of everyone else. By integrating Unnecessary Creating into your routine, you open a channel for that pent-up creative energy to be released.</div>

<div class="blockquote">When we spend all of our time and energy creating on-demand, it&rsquo;s easy to lose touch with the passions that fuel our best work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But what if you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;I barely have the time and energy to do what&rsquo;s required of me for my job, and now you want me to take up a hobby?&rdquo; It is tempting to resist Unnecessary Creating because you think it will add stress to your life&mdash;yet another thing you have to cram into your schedule.<br /><br />In fact, the experience of those who regularly practice Unnecessary Creating is quite different. They find that it actually clarifies their thoughts, makes them more effective, and reintroduces a level of passion to their dayjob. What&rsquo;s more, Unnecessary Creating is frequently the best source of new insights for our on-demand creative work.<br /><br />--<br /><strong>What&rsquo;s Your Take?</strong><br /><br />Do you do any &ldquo;Unnecessary Creating&rdquo;?</div>

Anticipation was huge with tickets selling out five months in advance and over 300 people on the waiting list. We expanded to two days at the gorgeous Times Center, adopted a new format, and assembled an incredible lineup of speakers - including luminaries from Pixar, Google Ideas, IDEO, FuseProject, and <em>This American Life</em>. (For details, check out our summary of the <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7026/99-Conference-2011-Key-Insights-on-Idea-Execution">2011 conference takeaways</a>.)</div>
<div>Which is all to say: We're extremely excited about 2012. To help us streamline planning, we're launching ticket sales a bit earlier this year: <strong>Tickets for the 99% Conference 2012 will officially go on sale on July 19th, 2011 at 12pm EST. </strong>At that time, we will publish the registration link on the <a href="http://the99percent.com/conference">99% Conference homepage</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The official conference dates will be May 3-4, 2012 at the Times Center in New York City. For two days, creative leaders from across industries will come together to focus purely on the mechanics of idea execution, as our speakers share their hard-won lessons learned in a series of 20-minute talks and interactive master classes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We have not yet announced the official schedule and speaker lineup, but we&rsquo;re already hard at work planning a knockout program for 2012. The overall structure and schedule will be similar to the 2011 conference (view the <a href="http://the99percent.com/conference/schedule">2011 schedule</a>), though we&rsquo;re planning to add some exciting new innovations in our quest to create an ever more awesome conference experience for you.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Due to the intimate size of the conference &ndash; just under 400 people &ndash; tickets will sell out very quickly. If you&rsquo;re interested in attending the 99% Conference in 2012, we highly recommend purchasing early. </strong></div>
<div><br />Looking forward to seeing you in 2012!</div>

<div><span class="intro">It&rsquo;s all well and good to tweet about what you had for lunch, or share party pics on Facebook, but what if you want to use social media to achieve a specific goal? Perhaps to garner support for a creative project, or build awareness about a product you&rsquo;re launching. How then do you wade through all the social media speak and interact with people in a way that will make a difference to your mission, not just create more idle chatter?</span>I talked with a handful of social media mavens, community managers, and grassroots organizers to get their tips on navigating the social sphere. Here are a few pointers on rising above mere fans and followers numbers to create relationships that will really move the needle on your creative endeavor.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.etsy.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dave Brown /// Social Media Specialist, Etsy</strong></span></a></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Being the mayor of Whole Foods on Foursquare isn't going to make your idea happen. </strong>Don't get caught up in followers, likes, or check-ins. If you keep doing what you love, share your creativity and inspiration - that's how you move the needle.</li>
<li><strong>Somewhere right now there's an online conversation happening about what you're interested in - join it. </strong>Find these conversations and get involved - keep the message short but let your passion show. Use plenty of visuals. Instagram is a great place to start documenting your ideas from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Let people in on how excited you are about your idea. </strong>The best way to get people excited about what you're doing is to let your passion show. Share the process, ideology, and execution.</li>
<li><strong>There's nothing more rewarding than feeling like you're a part of something, so let your audience in on your project.</strong> A great way to engage your community is to ask for their input. Share your experiences, and ask for something back from them. </li>

<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>If your current circle of friends and contacts were enough to help you reach your goal, you would be there already.</strong> Finding a new community, one filled with people who are already doing what you want to be doing, will push you to accomplish it yourself. But only if you jump in. </li>
<li><strong>To feel connected and inspired, you can&rsquo;t stand on the sidelines. </strong>In community, as in any aspect of life, you get out of it what you put in. Passive lurking or anonymous posting is just not as rewarding as immersing yourself and forming relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Face-to-face interactions help you push your thinking.</strong> I&rsquo;m at Meetup because I get more out of in-person interactions than I do with pure online discussions. For example, the people I&rsquo;ve met in the Lean Startup Meetup that I co-organize have become some of my favorite people in NYC, and help motivate me to look at things in a new way.</li>
</ul>
<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cindy Au /// Director of Community, Kickstarter</strong></span></a><br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Think of your community as collaborators - not an audience.</strong> The people most likely to engage with you are those who know what you&rsquo;re going through and appreciate the kind of work you do. Go through it together, and in the process, you&rsquo;ll begin building a really powerful creative community.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t overload people with enthusiasm. </strong>Nothing comes off as more suspiciously non-human than frantically beating people with enthusiasm about your ideas and products. Find a balance, and be authentic.</li>
<li><strong>Your audience needs to care about you before they care about what you have to say. </strong>Build your audience just as you would in real life - by being a real person, and by devoting real time to individual relationships. Take the time to delve into what others are doing and share their work with your community - that kind of generosity and collaborative interaction goes a long way. It&rsquo;s a complete rejection of the &ldquo;all about me&rdquo; tendencies that the Internet can breed, and it&rsquo;s what lays the foundation for lasting communities to support you and your work.</li>

<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>The most important way to engage is with individual outreach.</strong> If there&rsquo;s someone you think would be valuable to your community, find what makes them unique or what they recently wrote, and be sure to call attention to any mutual connections. Instead of writing a mass email or a broad tweet, target the message to the person.</li>
<li><strong>Nothing replaces the deeper connection brought about by face-to-face interaction. </strong>The Internet makes it easier to find the right people. Once they're found and you've begun to build a relationship, hop offline and grab some coffee with them. In different cities? Skype may help strengthen the connection.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate every person who celebrates you. </strong>If you have something great, people will start engaging on your behalf. When this happens - be sure to acknowledge this and check out what they have going on as well. </li>
</ul>
<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://improveverywhere.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Charlie Todd /// Founder, Improv Everywhere</strong></span></a><br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t treat your community as just &ldquo;fans&rdquo; or &ldquo;followers.&rdquo; </strong>It&rsquo;s important to take the trust between you and the community you lead very seriously. For example - with Improv Everywhere - thousands of people might show up at a given event, without even knowing what they&rsquo;ll be asked to do. I have to respect this trust they&rsquo;re giving me as the leader, and respond by working hard to design these experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t focus on the monetary aspect of a project too early - build your brand and community because you love it, and success will find you.</strong> I wasn&rsquo;t able to treat Improv Everywhere as my full-time job for the first 8 years. It was always my passion that I focused on every chance I could outside of a day job - if I had worried about a business model when I began, I never would have found success. It was always about the ideas - bringing the ideas to life is what got me excited. It was only later on that I found ways to make it my living, but that was never the point.</li>

He speaks in a gentle voice with an undercurrent of hard-won confidence. This makeup serves him well, as he can perhaps be best described as a decathlete of creative pursuits. Whatever the event - be it design, web, writing or film - he has shape-shifted and doggedly worked his way to the top over and over again.</div>
<div>His resum&eacute; is a zig zag of creative risks. Early on Curtis spent ten years pursuing music and then taught himself design and web software out of desperation after he was dropped by his record label. He rose through the ranks to head up Macromedia&rsquo;s Flash efforts, then formed his own shop and designed sites for Yahoo and Adobe. Next, he got into short films as a side project and recently completed a feature-length film called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rideriseroar.com/"><em>Rise, Ride, Roar</em></a>, about legendary musician and Talking Heads frontman David Byrne.</div>
<div><br />To date, Curtis&rsquo; three books - <em>Flash Web Design</em>, <em>MTIV,</em> and <em>Creating Short Films for the Web</em> - have sold well over 150,000 copies and are required reading in design schools around the world.</div>
<div><br />I sat down with him on a recent afternoon in Brooklyn, New York to chat about his facility for reinvention - and the risks, challenges, and fears that come with it.</div>
<div><br /><strong>It seems like you had it made with Macromedia and Flash&nbsp; - literally writing the book on it - why did you move on? </strong></div>
<div>For me Flash was all about motion graphics on the web, so there was a bit of a connection to film. At the time it was very light on the code end of things, and while I can code, it&rsquo;s not something I truly wanted to do. And I was having more and more success doing site design, so I decided to pursue that and start my own site design studio. We had anywhere from 5 - 18 full-time employees and started landing these big sites like Yahoo and Met Opera.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I found over time that these types of sites became less and less about design and more about system design. The value was on social networking, database integration, CMS... and the value of things like color, typography, and composition seemed to take a backseat a bit. &nbsp;As a result, I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying the work as much.</div>
<div><br />I had started to make short films around this time and one day, after banging my head against the wall while chanting &ldquo;Expression Engine&rdquo; over and over, I decided it was time to try my hand at making films.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;">Curtis on location in Bali, shooting with Stefan Sagmeister.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Having worked your way to the top twice and having had some awful jobs in the process, </strong><strong>was it daunting start over yet again</strong><strong>?</strong><br />You know it was hard. To answer the phone and say, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not doing site design anymore&rdquo; took me a full two years to get up the courage to do it.&nbsp; I took on some projects that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have and did so mainly for the money. Looking back, those jobs didn&rsquo;t turn out that well either. It&rsquo;s one of those things that I should always remember, to try and take the courageous route.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Why leave the web for film?</strong><br />Around this time of designing these big sites, I found myself just wanting to get back moving images, and I was lucky because prosumer cameras were finally becoming affordable. At first, I left all the settings on auto because I didn&rsquo;t know how to adjust everything and instead focused on just making movies. I had a tripod, a boom mic, and a bicycle and I would ride around Manhattan doing these short films on different creatives like Milton Glaser, Stefan Sagmeister, Lawrence Weiner &ndash; I called it the &lsquo;Artist Series&rsquo; &ndash; and by doing so, I learned the craft of filmmaking and the technology along the way. Most everything I&rsquo;ve learned in film or otherwise has been by just diving in and doing it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">It&rsquo;s one of those things that I should always remember, to try and take the courageous route.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>Would you say there&rsquo;s a common thread that runs through all of your work?</strong><br />The one thing I&rsquo;ve gotten good at from doing all these different pursuits is finding a central theme in a project. If you can find that theme or story in your subject, the solution will present itself to you.</div>
<div><br /><strong>What&rsquo;s your theme?</strong><br />I think it is reinvention.</div>
<div><br /><strong>When you set out to reinvent yourself in a new field, how do you counter the panicked inner voice that says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the hell I&rsquo;m doing?&rdquo;</strong><br />I think it&rsquo;s only natural in the beginning to try and assert control over that creative process, and I&rsquo;m always trying to optimize.</div>
<div><br />When I first got into doing documentary films I would write all the interview questions out and bring them to the shoot. But I found I was getting shitty interviews by trying to impose a linear storyline on the films.</div>
<div><br />The best lesson I got in letting go was when I interviewed Milton Glaser for the artist series. I could sense he was bored as I read my questions. I was asking him the same questions he&rsquo;d answered a million times before. However, we were in his fantastic four story brownstone that housed all his work, so I decided to wing it, stopped the shoot, and asked if I could have a tour.</div>
<div><br /> He agreed and I ended up getting all this great footage of him pulling out sketchbooks he did in Paris in the '50s and reminiscing as he shuffled through thousands of posters he&rsquo;s designed over the years. It&rsquo;s powerful stuff, and it would have been impossible to get that kind of insight and dialogue in a typical interview setting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Today, I still prepare and write questions, but I&rsquo;m comfortable leaving them at the studio. If you can get comfortable leaving a big space, the subject will tell you what the story is.</div>

<div><strong>Having earned notoriety across all these endeavors, how do you respond when people try to pin you down?</strong><br />I&rsquo;ve kinda gotten used to shrugging it off. I had the &ldquo;Flash guy&rdquo; label for a long time, and that&rsquo;s faded away in large part. When I was working my way into film, I had an agent that kept trying to pitch me as a platform - I could shoot a film and code it up for the web. I just kept saying no, as I have no interest in going that direction. I would much rather focus on writing and directing films. It&rsquo;s important to have a direction of where you&rsquo;re going for knowing where to say no.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Most everything I&rsquo;ve learned in film or otherwise has been by just diving in and doing it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>You&rsquo;ve worked with world-class creatives. Are you comfortable around them?</strong><br />I still get nervous. I&rsquo;m actually pretty introverted but I&rsquo;m fascinated by people&rsquo;s stories. If I can find the story, I can then make connections with people through the artistic endeavor. It can be brutal getting to the story though, but when it&rsquo;s time to do the shoot or interview I&rsquo;m never nervous. Never.</div>
<div><br />A funny story along these lines concerns David [Byrne]. Even after making the <em>Ride, Rise, Roar</em> film, I would still feel a bit intimidated when I was around him. At one of the premieres, we were chatting afterwards and he said his daughter was attending design school in Oakland. Turns out the book they were using in class was one I wrote called <em>MTIV: Process, Inspiration and Practice for the New Media Designer</em>. At that point I thought, &ldquo;Alright I can relax a little now.&rdquo;</div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;"><br /><em>&nbsp;</em></span></div>
<div><strong>What do you consider your biggest successes?</strong><br />[Curtis shifts uncomfortably in his chair and glances out the window.] I feel like I&rsquo;ve only had a few out and out successes. I think the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/MTIV-Process-Inspiration-Practice-Designer/dp/0735711658"><em>MTIV</em></a> book and the short films in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/index.php?/film/view/artist_series/">Artist Series</a> I did are up there. Maybe the films &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/index.php?/film/watch/bridge/">Bridge</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/index.php?/film/watch/embrace/">Embrace</a>&rdquo; in my short dramatic work... and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rideriseroar.com/"><em>Ride,Rise, Roar</em></a> is good... but really, only a few so far.<br /><br /><strong>How did you develop this mindset of reinvention?</strong></div>
<div>I was given a lot of freedom growing up. My mother was an art teacher and never put a lot of pressure on me to pursue a particular path. I originally went to school for creative writing and film. I then spent 10 years pursuing music and after failing at that I did various random jobs. I got into design out of desperation - I didn&rsquo;t want to wait tables or pound nails again - without ever even having touched a computer. <br /><br /><strong>So you weren&rsquo;t focused from a young age? </strong></div>
<div>Oh no, not at all. You know how some kids know what they want to be at 15? I wasn&rsquo;t one of those kids. At times I&rsquo;ve wished I was that kid, though.</div>
<div><br /><strong>How do you look back on your career so far?</strong><br />I can see it a couple of ways, either as a series of detours, or I can look at as a righteous path that&rsquo;s never going to end. If I see whatever I&rsquo;m currently doing as just another stop along the way, then I think I&rsquo;m on the right path.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Drawing on his extensive research into radical extremism, Google Ideas Director Jared Cohen launched a new program that will bring together former militants and extremists from around the world to foster an "intellectual collision." Through his narrative, Cohen shares the importance of unstoppable passion, the value of misperceptions, and why we shouldn't mind being called crazy.<br /><br /><span class="header">About Jared Cohen</span><br />Jared Cohen is the Director of Google Ideas and an Adjunct Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. From 2006 to 2010 he served as a member of the Secretary of State's Policy Planning Staff and a close advisor to both Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, where he was not only the youngest member of Policy Planning in history, but also one of the few appointees kept on in both administrations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He was one of the principal architects of what has become known as &ldquo;21st century statecraft&rdquo;, which is a new approach to foreign policy that leverages and harnesses the power of connection technologies and new stakeholders for defense, diplomacy, and development.<br /><br />Prior to his time in government, Cohen traveled extensively throughout Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Afghanistan, where he spent time interviewing terrorists from groups like Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda to better understand the recruitment process, the nature and root causes of radicalization, and the dynamics between the terrorist groups and the communities they live in.<br /><br /><span class="header">Links</span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Cohen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Cohen</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="Http://twitter.com/jaredcohen">http://twitter.com/jaredcohen</a></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/the99percent/DPIn/~4/XmD603eMst4" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Behance Team";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://the99percent.com/videos/7042/Jared-Cohen-Dont-Pursue-Ideas-With-Obvious-Conclusions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

So in the spirit of simplification, three perspectives on how to reduce &ldquo;brain clutter&rdquo; and streamline your workflow:<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>1. Simplicity of Access: centralize your essential materials.</strong><br />If your work materials are scattered all over the place, it&rsquo;s difficult to be productive. Instead of solving problems, you spend your time trying to remember where things are, or on transferring them to where they should be. Rather than finishing the blog post you need to publish, you&rsquo;re trying to figure out if it&rsquo;s on your laptop at home, or your desktop at the office. Rather than executing on your action steps from last week&rsquo;s meeting, you&rsquo;re trying to remember where you wrote them down.<br />&nbsp;<br />If this type of scenario sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s time to centralize. I personally use the cloud for most things: <a target="_blank" href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> for all my email, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com">GoogleDocs</a> for text documents and spreadsheets, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for storing files. I&rsquo;m constantly working between home, the office, and other random locations, so it makes remembering where everything is a no-brainer. For my task list, I use a notepad, because a key part of remembering what I have to do is physically writing it down.</div>
<div><br />Of course, how to centralize depends on your specific needs, so your solution may be completely different than mine. &nbsp;For instance, Levenger&rsquo;s <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7036/Steve-Leveen-A-Tabula-Rasa-Is-Peace-of-Mind">Steve Leveen</a> can&rsquo;t store all of his organizational tools in the proverbial cloud, so he keeps a supply drawer &ndash; with identical materials &ndash; in both of his work locations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">If your work materials are scattered all over the place, it&rsquo;s difficult to be productive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>2. Simplicity of Space: give yourself a blank slate for creation.</strong><br />As we all know, creatives are distractible creatures &ndash; and a messy desk doesn&rsquo;t help. Erin Doland of Unclutterer <a target="_blank" href="http://unclutterer.com/2011/03/29/scientists-find-physical-clutter-negatively-affects-your-ability-to-focus-process-information/">paraphrases a recent study</a> published by the Princeton University Neuroscience Institute in which science confirms what we&rsquo;ve always suspected:<br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="pullquote">When your environment is cluttered, the chaos restricts your ability to focus. The clutter also limits your brain&rsquo;s ability to process information. Clutter makes you distracted and unable to process information as well as you do in an uncluttered, organized, and serene environment.</span><br />In short, there&rsquo;s a reason why yoga studios don&rsquo;t look like your grandmother&rsquo;s attic: It ain&rsquo;t zen. If you want to increase your efficiency, you need to reduce distractions. Consider removing everything from your desktop that isn&rsquo;t absolutely essential to the work you do every day. If that isn&rsquo;t possible, try to find a quiet retreat elsewhere &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s a conference room, an empty work table, or a nook at your local coffeeshop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>3. Simplicity of Tools: explore your ideas with pen and paper.</strong><br />We&rsquo;ve become so accustomed to using advanced tools that we sometimes forget how efficient we can be with a pen and paper. Yet, in the early stages of developing an idea, quickly sketching out your thoughts on paper is often the best approach. As designer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool/">Mike Rohde</a> writes, &ldquo;Sketching provides a unique space that can help you think differently, generate a variety of ideas quickly, explore alternatives with less risk, and encourage constructive discussions.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />While complex programs are great for creating finished products, they&rsquo;re not necessarily the quickest way to figure out the broad strokes of a solution. So ask yourself: Are you pushing around pixels in Photoshop, when you could be sketching? Are you fiddling around needlessly with PowerPoint effects, when you could just storyboard your talk on index cards?<br />&nbsp;<br />If there&rsquo;s a simpler way, challenge yourself to try it. It just might be faster.<br /><br />--<br /><strong>How Do You Simplify?</strong><br /><br />What have you done to simplify your workflow that&rsquo;s worked well?<br /><br />--<br /><em>For more tips on improving your daily productivity, check out 99%'s &ldquo;<a href="http://the99percent.com/blackberry">Daily Action</a>&rdquo; series, presented by BlackBerry.

A recent, more personal series, quietly documents his farewell to his father, a man unwilling to accept his wife&rsquo;s death in the last years of his life.&nbsp;</span>Behind all of these investigations lies an obsession with the idea of delusion:<br />The stories we tell ourselves to get by, the nationalistic ideals we revere, the desires we will suspend disbelief to fulfill. In his latest project, Toledano turns his questioning lens on himself. With the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mrtoledano.com/Kim-Jong-Phil"><em>Kim Jong Phil</em></a> series, he examines the dictatorial delusions of the artist, recreating existing artworks of "great leaders" and casting himself as the lead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is all to say nothing of Toledano's extremely successful commercial career, in which he's translated his offbeat aesthetic for publications including <em>The New Yorker, NYT Magazine, Fast Company, Interview, Maxim</em>, and many more.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I talked with Toledano by phone about the unexpected success of his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dayswithmyfather.com/"><em>Days With My Father</em></a> series and how hearing from your audience can have a huge impact.</div>
<div><br /><strong>How does an idea come to you, and how do you know what to run with?</strong><br />I wish I knew where the ideas came from. I wish I could go to a store and I could just browse the shelves for ideas. It would certainly be much less terrifying, because not knowing where they come from is frightening. I always think maybe I&rsquo;ll never have anymore ideas ever again. <br /><br />I just think about ideas for awhile. I guess the way in which I can tell if they&rsquo;re good or not often is in the talking about the idea itself. So I&rsquo;ll talk to friends and say &lsquo;Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m thinking about this thing.&rsquo; And if it feels right, inside to me, I&rsquo;ll start doing it. <br /><br /><strong>How do you push yourself in your work? </strong><br />I often look at stuff on the web. I find inspiration in painting and sculpture. I wish I could think of things that were that surprising. I feel that I&rsquo;m not nearly good enough. So I just want to be better. That&rsquo;s the biggest challenge. I want to surprise myself more and be able to look at something I&rsquo;ve done and think &lsquo;F*ck, where does that idea come from?&rsquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How did you come to document the period of your life during <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dayswithmyfather.com/"><em>Days With My Father</em></a>? </strong><br />I took care of my dad for three years before he died, but I took photographs for probably a year and a half. And I probably took about 150 photographs in all. And that&rsquo;s very few photographs, just because I didn&rsquo;t want the process of taking photographs to overwhelm taking care of my father. I started writing things down, specific experiences or things he said, really just because I have a miserable memory. <br /><br /><strong>Did you expect the project to reach so many people? </strong><br />In some ways it was such an extraordinary experience and such an extraordinary surprise because I didn&rsquo;t think anyone would have any interest in that work at all. I mean I did it for myself and I felt that it was much too personal. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone would be able to connect with it. <br /><br />But then when I put it up online, this sort of magical thing happened, and I just started getting thousands of emails. I think like 1.8 million people have been to the site, and then there&rsquo;s a book-to-movie deal, so all this sort of things have happened. But I think more than that, the most amazing thing about that work is it redirected me in a sense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">When I put it up online, this sort of magical thing happened.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How so? </strong><br />First of all, it was a real honor. You don&rsquo;t get a chance often in life to help people. And so for whatever reason, this work seems to help people out. I mean I got an email from this woman yesterday: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been so moved by your book I felt the need to write to tell you how beautiful it was. I never had a relationship with my father and I feel the need to contact him. This is probably just a temporary lapse of sanity, but I felt compelled to let you know that you may just have changed my life.&rsquo;<br /><br />And that&rsquo;s not unusual. I get emails everyday like this. People say the most extraordinary things. It&rsquo;s really mind-blowing to me, and really an incredible honor. And I feel that if I died tomorrow, at least I&rsquo;ve done something worthwhile in the world. I mean maybe it&rsquo;s just for a tiny amount of people, but at least I&rsquo;ve done something. Which is a lot more than I could have said a few years ago.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How did it feel to reach the masses with this project?</strong><br />Well it&rsquo;s interesting because I think about the art world a lot.&nbsp; And I think about, you know, when you go to a gallery and read an artist&rsquo;s statement. It&rsquo;s terribly incomprehensible, right? It&rsquo;s just kind of a simple club sandwich, layered cake extravaganza of references and connotations and words and people&rsquo;s names, none of which means anything to me. And I feel like it&rsquo;s almost directed not toward anyone, but the very tiny biosphere of curators and gallerists and the art world, right? So we&rsquo;re all in this world talking to ourselves and it&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve. But part of me feels as though it would be nice if art makes things better for people, for the world in some way, if it shows them something that is possible. <br /><br />So the thing with <em>Days of My Father </em>I realized, and I only realized this in retrospective, is it&rsquo;s a book about love. And it&rsquo;s a book about, I guess if you were to look at it objectively, it&rsquo;s a book about the idea that saying goodbye can be a really extraordinary beautiful thing. We realize that we have to say goodbye to our parents at some point, but it can be a really beautiful experience if you look at it that way. And that, if you show it to other people, it&rsquo;s giving people something useful in a way. And I guess I would hope that my work would be useful to people in some way, as well as to myself.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Is that going to be the benchmark going forward?</strong><br />I remember saying this as a kid. My father&rsquo;s an artist and I remember talking to him about wanting to be an artist and saying to him if I can do art that changes people over time, shows them something for a second or a minute, changes their mind about something, that would be really worthwhile. <br /><br />So, that&rsquo;s always been my intention. But ultimately I can only make the art that I can make. I just do the ideas that speak to me and I talk about the stuff that&rsquo;s interesting to me. Hopefully that will be of value to other people. <br /><br />That&rsquo;s where <em>Kim Jong Phil</em> comes in. I could just be f*cking talking to myself. I mean that&rsquo;s the thing that you don&rsquo;t know. Am I just bullshitting? Am I just drinking my own urine and telling myself it&rsquo;s the finest red wine available? I have no idea. You know what I mean? You don&rsquo;t know. You just hope that you make stuff that matters, firstly to yourself and secondly to other people.</div>

Ernest Hemingway, Writer /// Spring 1954</strong></a></div>
<div>Conducted by the late <em>Paris Review</em> co-founder George Plimpton in Madrid, this interview with Ernest Hemingway is an absolute knockout. The excerpt comes from the intro, where Plimpton describes Hemingway&rsquo;s workspace in detail.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote">A working habit he has had from the beginning, Hemingway stands when he writes. He stands in a pair of his oversized loafers on the worn skin of a lesser kudu&mdash;the typewriter and the reading board chest-high opposite him.<br /><br />When Hemingway starts on a project he always begins with a pencil, using the reading board to write on onionskin typewriter paper. He keeps a sheaf of the blank paper on a clipboard to the left of the typewriter, extracting the paper a sheet at a time from under a metal clip that reads &ldquo;These Must Be Paid.&rdquo; He places the paper slantwise on the reading board, leans against the board with his left arm, steadying the paper with his hand, and fills the paper with handwriting which through the years has become larger, more boyish, with a paucity of punctuation, very few capitals, and often the period marked with an X. The page completed, he clips it facedown on another clipboard that he places off to the right of the typewriter.<br /><br />Hemingway shifts to the typewriter, lifting off the reading board, only when the writing is going fast and well, or when the writing is, for him at least, simple: dialogue, for instance.<br /><br />He keeps track of his daily progress&mdash;&ldquo;so as not to kid myself&rdquo;&mdash;on a large chart made out of the side of a cardboard packing case and set up against the wall under the nose of a mounted gazelle head. The numbers on the chart showing the daily output of words differ from 450, 575, 462, 1250, back to 512, the higher figures on days Hemingway puts in extra work so he won&rsquo;t feel guilty spending the following day fishing on the Gulf Stream.</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/oct/03/interview-marina-abramovic-performance-artist"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></div>

I became a vegetarian, I did deep meditation, I cleansed myself. I train the body and the mind. I learn to eat certain foods so that I don't have to go to the toilet for seven hours. I learn to sleep in short bursts at night. This is very hard: sleep, wake, drink, pee, exercise, sleep, wake and on and on. So even the not-performing is intense."<br /><br />The sitting-still, she says, was the worst part and choosing a wooden chair without armrests her biggest mistake. "This one detail makes it hellish. The shoulders sag, the arms swell, the pain starts to increase. Then the ribs are going into the organs. I had an incredible amount of physical pain and even some out-of-body experiences where the pain just vanishes, but always it comes back.

<div><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/steve-jobs-in-1994-the-rolling-stone-interview-20110117"><strong>3. Steve Jobs, Apple CEO /// June 1994</strong></a><br />In this vintage interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em>, you can see Steve Jobs' brain at work. Seventeen years ago, he's already thinking about the software strategy that will support the iPhone and the iPad.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Jobs:</strong> As you know, most of what I've done in my career has been software. The Apple II wasn't much software, but the Mac was just software in a cool box. We had to build the box because the software wouldn't run on any other box, but nonetheless, it was mainly software. I was involved in PostScript and the formation of Adobe, and that was all software. And what we've done with NEXTSTEP is really all software. We tried to sell it in a really cool box, but we learned a very important lesson. When you ask people to go outside of the mainstream, they take a risk. So there has to be some important reward for taking that risk or else they won't take it.<br /><br />What we learned was that the reward can't be one and a half times better or twice as good. That's not enough. The reward has to be like three or four or five times better to take the risk to jump out of the mainstream.<br /><br />The problem is, in hardware you can't build a computer that's twice as good as anyone else's anymore. Too many people know how to do it. You're lucky if you can do one that's one and a third times better or one and a half times better. And then it's only six months before everybody else catches up. But you can do it in software. As a matter of fact, I think that the leap that we've made is at least five years ahead of anybody.<br /><br />&hellip;<br /><br /><strong>Interviewer: </strong>You can't open the paper these days without reading about the Internet and the information superhighway. Where is this all going?<br /><br /><strong>Jobs:</strong> The Internet is nothing new. It has been happening for 10 years. Finally, now, the wave is cresting on the general computer user. And I love it. I think the den is far more interesting than the living room. Putting the Internet into people's houses is going to be really what the information superhighway is all about, not digital convergence in the set-top box. All that's going to do is put the video rental stores out of business and save me a trip to rent my movie. I'm not very excited about that. I'm not excited about home shopping. I'm very excited about having the Internet in my den.</span></div>

<div><a target="_blank" href="http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/art%20news/905N-000-001.html"><strong>4. Ansel Adams, Photographer /// Summer 1984</strong></a></div>
<div>In the last interview he ever gave, photographer Ansel Adams describes how he visualizes and then creates a photograph.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Interviewer: </strong>You have used the word "visualization" to describe the process of deciding in advance how a photo will look rather than just shooting away in the hope of getting something lucky. Would you say that's the essence?<br /><br /><strong>Adams:</strong> I'd say that's the essence. There are two approaches. One is the contrived approach-when you're in the studio and you set up your backgrounds and your subject and you work with lights, or when you arrange things in nature and try to make that work. The other approach - which I think is the more productive in the end-is straight photography. You come across a phenomenon in nature that you can visualize as an image. Then, if you have the craft, you proceed to make it. Without failure. In theory, I have no excuse for ever making a mistake. I might not have an expressive picture, but at least I should capture everything I want - providing I don't make some misjudgment or some stupid arithmetic error. I can be working on a close-up subject and forget to account for the extension of the limb. And I can put on a filter and not give the proper exposure factor and all that. Those things happen to everybody - to me, too - and it can be very embarrassing.<br /><br />I think of Stieglitz's definition of photography - a paraphrase of what I heard him say many times. In the earlier days, when people were very scornful of what he called "creative photography" or "photography as art," they would ask: "Mr. Stieglitz, how do you go about making the creative photograph?" He would answer, "When I have a desire to photograph, I go out in the world with my camera. I come across something that excites me emotionally and esthetically. I'm creatively excited. I see the picture in my mind's eye and I make the exposure and I give you the print as the equivalent of what I saw and felt." The word "equivalent" is very important. It's two things - what is seen and what is felt about it. That's why the naturalistic element in photography is very important. When you intentionally depart from the natural situation you can get into trouble. Unless you depart far enough.</span><br /><br /><img title="braun_550" alt="braun_550" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/braun_550.png" height="480" width="550" /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Braun signal radio ABR 21.

This interview catches him just before a recent retrospective at the Design Museum in London called <a target="_blank" href="http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2009/2009-2009-dieter-rams"><em>Less And More</em></a>.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Your phrase &ldquo;less but better&rdquo; was initially read as an endorsement for purity in design. But it has been adopted as an environmental message about reduction and sustainability. What does the global community need to do to address that secondary message?<br /><br /><strong>Rams: </strong>We live today with a lot of chaos, and designers should concentrate on helping to lighten the chaos, including the noise. Nobody notices any more that we&rsquo;re living with a lot of noise. We don&rsquo;t register the chaos; sometimes, yes, when we are in the middle of traffic or running late, we discover that everything is chaotic around us. It&rsquo;s London, it&rsquo;s Frankfurt it&rsquo;s Berlin&mdash;it&rsquo;s what Corbusier used to say about New York in the &rsquo;30s: It&rsquo;s a "wonderful catastrophe". Now all our cities around the world are wonderful catastrophes. We have to think much more about what we really need: how often we need things and how many we need. If we want to stay on this planet 50 years from now then we have to take that more seriously.<br /><br /><strong>Interviewer:</strong> For many people the chaos in the environment is mirrored in their own personal spaces, in the jumble of belongings. Is clutter ever a positive thing?<br /><br /><strong>Rams:</strong> In your personal surroundings there should be places where you have some disorder, so that you find the other places that are in order. Order with disorder&mdash;the contrast&mdash;can be sometimes fascinating. You have to have the difference; otherwise, you forget the feeling for order, for the necessary things.</span><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/magazine/feature-articles/arianna-huffington-tina-brown-interview"><strong>6. Arianna Huffington &amp; Tina Brown, Publishers /// February 2011</strong></a><br />Two of the prime movers in the online publishing world, Arianna Huffington and Tina Brown, founders of the Huffington Post and the Daily Beast, chat about coming of age as editors. <br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Interviewer: </strong>You've both been subjected to bad press along the way. How have you handled it?<br /><br /><strong>Huffington:</strong> I definitely consider it a barometer of my spiritual progress how I handle it. I don't like the idea of a thick skin. I think we can be more childlike. Children get upset and they cry and it's over; six seconds later, it's like nothing happened. That is my aspiration.<br /><br /><strong>Brown: </strong>I much less care about it than I used to. I went through Talk magazine, and once you've been pilloried on the front page of the New York Post, you do go through a kind of liberation. I took a huge belly flop in a very public fashion. After that, it was like, "So what? It wasn't so bad. I'm still here." It was probably the happiest couple of years of my life after that, suddenly having permission to meet my daughter at school and go and see a friend in the hospital. When I did the Beast, it was really for fun, and I wasn't sitting there worrying about it. [Bad press] can ruin an hour of your morning - but I haven't had that experience for a while, actually. I don't have a Google alert [for myself]; I don't care enough [laughs].<br /><br /><strong>Huffington: </strong>That's probably the most important message that we can give to younger women. I constantly talk to my daughters about my failures. The other day, Christina was saying, Oh no, Mom, not again about your first book being rejected by 36 publishers. Because in the end, if you look at what makes people succeed, especially women, it's about not giving up.<br /><br /><strong>Brown:</strong> You know, a friend of mine has a great saying: There's nobody more boring than the undefeated [laughs]. Any big career will have bad times as well as good. I'm sure, Arianna, your blacker periods have really been a source of learning.</span></div>

<div><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6017/the-art-of-comics-no-1-r-crumb"><strong>7. R. Crumb, Comic Artist /// June 2010</strong></a><br />This recent interview with comic artist R. Crumb inaugurated the <em>Paris Review</em>'s &ldquo;art of comics&rdquo; interview series. Here, Crumb talks about knocking on doors to get his start as a kid.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It must have been amazing to discover the mimeograph.<br /><br /><strong>Crumb:</strong> Well, I remember the first time I did a comic strip on it, I was in seventh grade and seeing that printed was really a thrill. There were fifty copies of it. Wow! The power of print! And then when I was fifteen my brother and I did kind of a Mad [magazine] imitation called Foo and we intended to print it, then sell it. We had jobs and we paid to have it printed on a Xerox machine where my father worked, and he ran off three hundred copies for us. It was very crudely printed, early Xerox where the blacks don&rsquo;t fill in solid black. But even that was a thrill to see. But we couldn&rsquo;t get people to buy it, it was devastating. We ended up going around door-to-door in this big tract-housing development in Dover, Delaware, near the Air Force base, and lying to the people, telling them it was an art project for school. That was the only way they would buy it.<br /><br /><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What were you charging?<br /><br /><strong>Crumb:</strong> Ten cents. We&rsquo;d hand it to them or they would say, Let me see that, and they&rsquo;d look at it and say, What is this? Well, it&rsquo;s a comic book we drew ourselves. Foo, what does that mean? They didn&rsquo;t get it, and they didn&rsquo;t want to buy it. Some people would interrogate us, You sure this money&rsquo;s going to the school, who&rsquo;s your art teacher over there? We told them the name of the art teacher, we said yeah, it&rsquo;s for school. Nobody ever called the school. But, it&rsquo;s a fucking dime, come on! Two guys selling these comics they drew themselves, these people they didn&rsquo;t give a shit, it didn&rsquo;t impress them at all. It really traumatized us about the comic-book business. We could do the drawing fine, pretty good and professional for our age, but the business end of it, boy, that was rough. We ended up burning most of them in the backyard.</span><br /><br /><img title="smith_550" alt="smith_550" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/smith_550.png" height="380" width="550" /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Patti Smith, circa 1969.

Patti Smith, Musician &amp; Writer /// 2010</strong></a><br /><em>Interview </em>magazine editor-at-large Christopher Bollen talks to rock icon Patti Smith upon the release of her incredible memoir, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Just-Kids-Patti-Smith/dp/006621131X"><em>Just Kids</em></a>, about her relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe<em>&nbsp;</em>. Here, she discusses the habits we bind to our creative process:<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Interviewer: </strong>I can drink an endless amount of coffee. I'm sure one day that will catch up with me.<br /><br /><strong>Smith: </strong>I used to drink like 14 cups a day. I was a pretty speedy person, but I never noticed. Then, when I was pregnant, I had to give up coffee. After that, I cut down to five or six cups. Ever since I hit 60, I drink only two. What I do is I get an Americano and a pot of water and I keep diluting it, because it's not even the coffee, it's the habit.<br /><br /><strong>Interviewer: </strong>That's my problem. I really don't smoke cigarettes that much except when I write. But when I write, I smoke. It's bad, but I'm scared that if I break the habit, I won't be able to write.<br /><br /><strong>Smith:</strong> It's part of your process. It's what you have to do. I'll tell you how to break it. You don't have to. Like, coffee was part of my process. Now, if I want to go to a caf&eacute; and write and drink coffee for two hours, I just order them. I don't drink them. A lot is just aesthetic. So you light your cigarette and let it sit there and don't smoke it.<br /><br /><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Do you think that would work?<br /><br /><strong>Smith:</strong> If you attach anything harmful to the creative process, you have to do that. If you learn nothing else from me, this is a really important lesson. I've seen a lot of people go down because they attach a substance to their creative process. A lot of it is purely habitual. They don't need it, but they think they do, so it becomes entrenched. Like, I can't go without my coffee. I can go without drinking it, but I can't go without it nearby. It's the feeling of how cool I feel with my coffee. Because I don't feel cool with this tea. [Bollen laughs] You know, there are pictures of me with cigarettes in the '70s, and everybody thought I smoked. I can't smoke because I had TB when I was a kid. But I loved the look of smoking -- like Bette Davis and Jeanne Moreau. So I would have cigarettes and just light 'em and take a couple puffs, but mostly hold them. Some people said that was hypocritical. But in my world, it wasn't hypocritical at all. I wasn't interested in actually smoking them. I just liked holding them to look cool. All right, was it a bad image to show people? I'm happy to let people know I wasn't really smoking.<br /><br /><strong>Interviewer: </strong>I think it's almost part of the romance of creating. As an artist, you kind of have to buy into your own romance a bit when you are making work.<br /><br /><strong>Smith: </strong>Yep. Except for me, I haven't really changed at all since I was 11. I still dress the same. I still have the same manners of study. Like when I was a kid, I wanted to write a poem about Simon Bolivar. I went to the library and read everything I could. I wrote copious notes. I had 40 pages of notes just to write a small poem. So my process hasn't changed much.</span><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/ESQ0102-JAN_CLOSE#ixzz1Pkb6PtpB"><strong>9.

His simple reply: &ldquo;I make decisions.&rdquo; We make hundreds, if not millions, of micro-decisions every day &ndash; from what to focus our energy on, to how to respond to an email, to what to eat for lunch. You could easily argue that becoming a better (and swifter) decision-maker would be the fastest route to improving your daily productivity.</div>
<div>After digging into the research, I learned that there are no hard and fast rules for decision-making. (If only!) There are, however, a number of interesting tendencies that play into how we decide, which we should all be aware of. <br /><br />Here&rsquo;s a quick stroll through some of the key findings on the art of decision-making:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1. Satisficers vs Maximizers. </strong></div>
<div>Coined by the economist Herbert Simon in 1956, &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisficing</a>&rdquo; is an approach to decision-making that prioritizes an <em>adequate solution</em> over an <em>optimal solution</em>. Gretchen Rubin sums up the difference between the two types of decision-makers well in a post over at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2006/06/are_you_a_satis.html">Happiness Project</a>:</div>
<div class="pullquote">Satisficers are those who make a decision or take action once their criteria are met. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ll settle for mediocrity; their criteria can be very high; but as soon as they find the car, the hotel, or the pasta sauce that has the qualities they want, they&rsquo;re satisfied.  <br /><br />Maximizers want to make the optimal decision. So even if they see a bicycle or a photographer that would seem to meet their requirements, they can&rsquo;t make a decision until after they&rsquo;ve examined every option, so they know they&rsquo;re making the best possible choice&hellip;<br /><br />In a fascinating book, The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz argues that satisficers tend to be happier than maximizers. Maximizers must spend a lot more time and energy to reach a decision, and they&rsquo;re often anxious about whether they are, in fact, making the best choice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You&rsquo;d think maximizers would at least feel content with their decision after all that work, but no! As anyone who&rsquo;s ever researched a possible illness on the Internet knows, more information does not necessarily lead to peace of mind or better decision-making.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Gathering additional information always comes at a cost. We&rsquo;re better off setting our criteria for making a decision in advance (as in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the call once I know X, Y, and Z&rdquo;). Once you have that information, make the choice and move on.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2. How less can be more. </strong></div>
<div>Psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, whose work was cited in the Malcolm Gladwell bestseller <em>Blink</em>, argues that we&rsquo;re designed to make smart snap decisions based on limited information. In fact, his research shows that we do it all the time. Here, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2007/11/19/less-information-is-more.html"><em>Newsweek</em></a> neatly sums up Gigerenzer&rsquo;s findings on the &ldquo;Take the Best&rdquo; strategy that most people use to make decisions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pullquote">"Take the best" means that you reason and calculate only as much as you absolutely have to; then you stop and do something else. So, for example, if there are 10 pieces of information that you might weigh in a thorough decision, but one piece of information is clearly more important than the others, then that one piece of information is often enough to make a choice. You don't need the rest; other details just complicate things and waste time.  <br /><br />Gigerenzer has demonstrated this in the laboratory. He asked a large number of parents to consider a scenario in which their child wakes up after midnight short of breath, wheezing and coughing. They are told that a doctor could make a home visit in 20 minutes; it's a physician they know but don't like all that much, because he never listens to their view. Alternatively, they could take their child to a clinic 60 minutes away; the doctors there are unknown, but good listeners by reputation. Which to choose?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the end, almost all of the parents based their decision on just one key piece of information: Whether or not the doctor was a good listener. Considered in this light, the wait time and other factors were just not that important.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Takeaway: </strong>We are designed to process information so quickly that &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladwell.com/blink/">rapid cognition</a>&rdquo; &ndash; decisions that spring from hard thinking based on sound experience &ndash; can feel more instinctive than scientific. Trust your gut.</div>
<div><br /><strong>3. The three kinds of intuition. </strong></div>
<div>In the creative and business worlds, you hear a lot of talk about intuition, and (see above) &ldquo;trusting your gut.&rdquo; But what does that really mean? It&rsquo;s less simple than you might think. Columbia Business School professor William Duggan believes that there are <a target="_blank" href="http://columbiapress.typepad.com/strategic_intuition/what-is-stra.html">three different types of intuition</a>:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pullquote">Ordinary intuition is just a feeling, a gut instinct. Expert intuition is snap judgments, when you instantly recognize something familiar, the way a tennis pro knows where the ball will go from the arc and speed of the opponent&rsquo;s racket&hellip; The third kind, strategic intuition, is not a vague feeling, like ordinary intuition. Strategic intuition is a clear thought&hellip; That flash of insight you had last night might solve a problem that&rsquo;s been on your mind for a month.<br /> &hellip;  <br />Expert intuition is always fast, and it only works in familiar situations. Strategic intuition is always slow, and it works for new situations, which is when you need your best ideas.  <br /><br />This difference is crucial, because expert intuition can be the enemy of strategic intuition. As you get better at your job, you recognize patterns that let you solve similar problems faster and faster. That&rsquo;s expert intuition at work. In new situations your brain takes much longer to make enough new connections to find a good answer. A flash of insight happens in only a moment, but it may take weeks for that moment to come. You can&rsquo;t rush it. But your expert intuition might see something familiar and make a snap judgment too soon. The discipline of strategic intuition requires you recognize when a situation is new and turn off your expert intuition. You must disconnect the old dots, to let new ones connect on their own.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Takeaway: </strong>We should trust our expert intuition (based on experience) when making choices about familiar problems. But when we need a break-through solution, we shouldn&rsquo;t be too quick to jump to conclusions.</div>
<div><br /><strong>4. Why we should trust experience. (Anyone's experience.)</strong><br /> Psychologist Daniel Gilbert, author of the bestseller <em>Stumbling on Happiness</em>, studies the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive biases</a> that we use to make decisions. According to Gilbert, we do not make very rational decisions in most cases, nor are we particularly good at predicting what will make us happy. (See his great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_researches_happiness.html">TED talk</a> for more on this.) <br /><br />Gilbert argues that if we don&rsquo;t have the knowledge or experience to make a decision, the best course of action is to <a target="_blank" href="http://thedartmouth.com/2009/05/26/news/decisions">just ask someone else</a>. Says Gilbert:  <br /><br /><span class="pullquote">In many domains of life, the experience of one randomly selected other person can beat your own best guess by a factor of two... We all like a trip to Paris better than gallbladder surgery; everybody would rather have a compliment than have their thumb nailed to the floor. The differences between you and other people are so unimportant that you would do better predicting how you are going to like something simply by asking one randomly chosen person how they like it.</span><br /><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If you&rsquo;re wrestling with a difficult decision, consult a friend or colleague who&rsquo;s been in your situation before. Their insight will likely be significantly more valuable than almost any research.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5. Choosing your battles. </strong></div>
<div>Some decisions, like how to handle a dicey client situation, are worth mulling over. Others, like deciding what brand of dental floss you buy, are not. Jonah Lehrer, author of <em>How We Decide</em>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/why-are-easy-decisions-so-hard/">points out</a> that we are constantly bullied into feeling like trivial decisions are incredibly important:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pullquote">The modern marketplace is a conspiracy to confuse, to trick the mind into believing that our most banal choices are actually extremely significant. Companies spend a fortune trying to convince us that only their toothpaste will clean our teeth, or that only their detergent will remove the stains from our clothes&hellip; Why does the average drug store contain 55 floss alternatives and more than 350 kinds of toothpaste? While all these products are designed to cater to particular consumer niches, they end up duping the brain into believing that picking a floss is a high-stakes game, since it&rsquo;s so damn hard. And so we get mired in decision-making quicksand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Ask yourself if this decision is really that meaningful. If it&rsquo;s not, stop obsessing over it, and just make a call!</div>

Things we&rsquo;d like to do, or know we should, but just don&rsquo;t seem to happen: exercise, diet, productivity or flossing longer than a week after the visit to the dentist.</span>In that sense, I&rsquo;m like most people - still a work in progress.<br /><br />But, unlike most people, I&rsquo;ve had on ongoing obsession with figuring out how to fix those lousy habits. I've spent thousands of hours being an experimental guinea pig, uncovering surprising findings, such as:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Implementing a daily exercise plan is easier than exercising 3 times per week</li>
<li>Changing 10 meals will change 90% of your eating habits</li>
<li>Learning a new skill or language can be accomplished with 5 minutes a day</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br />I don&rsquo;t expect most people to replicate my, perhaps unhealthy, obsession with self-experimentation. Instead, I want you to save years of trial and error so that you can fix bad habits without frustration.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Bother Changing Habits?</strong></span><br /><br />My obsession came from a simple idea: with the right conditioning, you could automatically do what you normally need willpower for.<br /><br />Many people make a commitment every January to start exercising. And, by February, many of them have already given up. That&rsquo;s because sustaining good behaviors normally takes a lot of effort.<br /><br />But with habits, you don&rsquo;t need willpower, they just happen. This concept - that everything I currently spent so much effort on could be made effortless had huge appeal. Even if perfect automation were impossible, if you could make those behaviors much easier then life would become more enjoyable as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to Change a Habit</strong></span><br /><br />The first principle is a conditioning period. This is a period of time when you put in effort to make the habit automatic.<br /><br />A good way to think of the conditioning period is like a rocket entering orbit. It takes fuel to escape gravity, but if you use the right trajectory, you can enter into an orbit, which prevents you from falling back to earth. The goal with creating a habit is to reach orbit (habit) before you run out of fuel (willpower).<br /><br />Also like a rocket, how you handle the conditioning phase can make a huge difference. A poor trajectory, and you may waste tons of fuel and never reach a stable orbit. The right approach, however, can make the habit change relatively easily.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1. Set a conditioning period.</strong><br />My practice is to set the default conditioning period for 30 days. Too short, and you&rsquo;ll fail to reach orbit. Too long, and you won&rsquo;t summon the initial motivation to overcome gravity.<br /><br />During those first 30 days, your goal is simple - turn the behavior into a habit. It may take longer than 30 days (studies show 66 is a closer mean for true habituation), but this is the period of complete focus.<br /><br />Making a habit is a different goal than many people have when they first start behavior changes. In most cases, people are after results - they want to lose weight, get a promotion, or master a skill.<br /><br />But forming a habit is different than getting results. Some of the tactics I&rsquo;ll describe are lousy for getting results, but perfect for quickly conditioning a habit.<br /><br />What many people fail to realize is that getting results is much easier once you already have the habit. Being fit is easy if you show up to the gym every day. Being a skilled writer is easier if you&rsquo;re already writing each day. Habits precede success.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Action Step:</strong> Focus on a 30-day conditioning period.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2. Make the habit every day.</strong><br />Another mistake people make is believing that performing a behavior 3 times a week is easier than doing it every day.<br /><br />In a na&iuml;ve way, this makes sense. After all, if you spend 30 minutes every day at the gym, that takes 3.5 hours per week - time out of an already busy schedule. Going twice, in contrast, only takes 1 hour. Therefore if you&rsquo;ve struggled to stick to exercising, going twice weekly is probably the best first step.<br /><br />The problem with this logic is it assumes time is the most relevant factor. But aside from rare cases, time is almost never the factor. For most people, if you added up all the wasted moments of procrastination, distraction or gaps between work, there would be more than a few hours left.<br /><br />If time isn&rsquo;t lacking, then why is it so difficult to &ldquo;find the time&rdquo;?<br /><br />The reason is that we may be able to find the time, but not the energy. Going to the gym, when it isn&rsquo;t a habit, requires willpower. After a busy day, you probably don&rsquo;t have a lot of spare willpower.<br /><br />Focusing on a daily habit, instead of 3 times a week, is better because the conditioning is stronger and the habit becomes automatic faster. Since every day you exercise, it quickly becomes an automatic part of your routine.<br /><br />I went through four conditioning periods before the habit of exercise finally stuck. After I did, the habit stuck for 6 years, so that I no longer need to exercise every day to sustain it. Exercising daily was the difference between the first three failures and the eventual success.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Action Step: </strong>Make the habit daily.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3. Strategically replace your biggest lost needs.</strong><br />Through a conditioning period and daily habits, you alter your trajectory to make it more likely you&rsquo;ll reach orbit before you run out of fuel. Replacing lost needs is a way of reducing gravity itself - so you are less likely to slide back to bad habits in a moment of weakness.<br /><br />Think of how many diet books exist. Each of them claims some magical cure for losing weight, and each promises to be easy to follow. Now think of how many people actually stick with them. What gives?<br /><br />Part of the problem is that diets focus only on removing bad habits, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat that!&rdquo; But this leaves a vacuum, which tends to pull people back to lousy ways of eating.<br /><br />The rationale behind this advice is that people want as much variety as possible - otherwise why would restrictive diets be difficult to follow?<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve found a different answer. People don&rsquo;t want variety. In fact, I&rsquo;d wager that the top 10 meals of the average person constitute 90% of what they end up eating. If variety were so important, why do people always eat the same meals?<br /><br />When I switched to a vegetarian diet five years ago, I focused less on what I shouldn&rsquo;t eat, and more on creating a new list of &ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; meals. If I could replace my menu with meals that fit my desired eating habits and taste buds, then my willpower would only be necessary for the less common occasions of eating outside that menu (such as restaurants or family dinners).<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Action Step:</strong> If you&rsquo;re giving something up, focus on replacing the most common 80-90% of that habit.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>4. Begin with the start in mind.</strong><br />Woody Allen famously quipped, &ldquo;80% of life is showing up.&rdquo; With habits, I&rsquo;d guess it&rsquo;s even higher.<br /><br />The trickiest part of starting a habit is the first step. If you&rsquo;ve got that handled, the rest usually flows smoothly.<br /><br />This is easy to understand intuitively. Exercising is mostly about that first step into the gym. Writing is mostly about opening up that blank page. Overcoming procrastination is mostly about the first five minutes of work.<br /><br />What I learned in creating habits was that this knowledge could allow anyone to make their conditioning efforts vastly more efficient. If the first step required the most conscious control, then habituating that first step would cover most of the habit itself.<br /><br />This means that learning a new skill or language doesn&rsquo;t need to begin with commitments to invest dozens of hours each week. Simply committing to starting for five minutes every day conditions you to get used to performing the habit.<br /><br />Once the conditioning period is over, it&rsquo;s much easier to scale up your efforts, than to build the habit from scratch.<br /><br />Since the conditioning period is a race between reaching orbit and running out of fuel, this principle has drastic implications. Conditioning the first 5-15 minutes of a habit takes a tenth of the effort, so even for stubborn habits, you can make them automatic before worrying about performance.<br /><br />One way to do this is to commit to only the first step of your habit in the 30-day trial, with the rest being optional. For example, committing to jogging every day, but not committing to any specific workout length (allowing you run for just 15 minutes if you really have no time).<br /><br />The advantage of this approach is that even though your commitment is minimal (5-15 minutes), in practice you&rsquo;ll probably do the entire habit most of the time. This lets you leverage a bit of willpower to get larger results.<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Action Step:</strong> Focus on making the first 5-15 minutes of your habit your &ldquo;must&rdquo; during the first 30 days.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Results from a Habit-Obsessed Life</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After repeating this process dozens of times, the intuition is that it would turn you into a robot. You&rsquo;d be so obsessed with performing your habits, that you wouldn&rsquo;t have space for spontaneity or fun.<br /><br />But my experience actually taught me the opposite - knowing how to change your habits gives you freedom. Like the discipline of the pianist frees him to play any song, the initial ability gives new flexibility.<br /><br />Knowing how to create habits lets you put your energies into other pursuits. I&rsquo;d rather put my time into figuring out how to write better, than worry about meeting my quota, or how to be stronger than guilt myself for missing the gym.<br /><br />If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned in my experimental odyssey, it is that we&rsquo;re all governed by habits. The difference is whether you control your habits, or whether they control you.</div>

The phrase "Death by PowerPoint" has been a clich&eacute; for years, but sadly the same clich&eacute;s are being perpetuated day in day out - slides "designed" using hideous templates, crawling with bullet points and paragraphs in tiny fonts, which presenters then read out in a monotone (turning their backs to the audience), using interchangeable meaningless corporate jargon.</span>But there is an alternative - and you hold the keys to it. <br /><br />Now, you may not consider yourself a natural presenter. Maybe, like many creatives, you are slightly shy by nature, at your most comfortable when seated at your desk or alone in the studio with your work. As an introverted poet, I can relate.<br /><br />But I managed to transform myself from someone who was terrified of standing up in front of an audience to an in-demand public speaker and workshop leader. Not only that, preparing and delivering presentations is now one of the things I enjoy most about my work. Here's how I did it - and how you can do the same:<br /><br /><em>Treat the presentation as a creative project in its own right.</em><br /><br />Don't think about "presenting your work," as if the creative part were limited to the work and the presentation were tacked on afterwards. Apply the same level of imagination and passion to your presentations as you do the rest of your creative work. Once you do that, you'll start discovering all kinds of interesting ways to get your message across in a persuasive fashion. Here are some tips to help you get started - and to illustrate why your creative talents are the perfect ingredients for a killer presentation.<br /><br /><strong>1. Tap your enthusiasm.</strong><br />Everyone I've ever coached on presentation skills has told me they want to be more confident - but I tell them to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wishfulthinking.co.uk/2006/11/24/5-reasons-why-enthusiasm-is-better-than-confidence/">forget about confidence and focus on enthusiasm</a>. Confidence can be impressive, but it can still leave an audience cold. Enthusiasm, on the other hand, is infectious - it will be hard for audiences to resist your passion.<br /><br /><strong>2. Get to the core of your message.</strong><br />If you're an information architect, you'll know how important it is to present the most important points clearly and simply, only introducing details when people have grasped the big picture and are ready for more. If organizing information is new to you, then here's the quick version:<br /><br /><strong>Boil your presentation down to three key points your audience must understand. </strong>This forces you to hone your message to its essence, and helps you remember the structure of your presentation (even if the worst happens and the projector fails). It will also make the message more memorable for your audience. For more detailed advice on structuring presentations, read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beyondbullets.com/">Cliff Atkinson</a>'s book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Bullet-Points-PowerPoint-Presentations/dp/0735627355/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307532728&amp;sr=8-3"><em>Beyond Bullet Points</em></a>.<br /><br /><strong>3. Tell a captivating story.</strong><br />Next time you hear a presenter say "I'll begin by telling you a story..." watch the audience - you'll see them relax into their chairs. They are re-entering the pleasant "storytime trance" they knew and loved as kids. Their critical guard is down, and the speaker has a golden opportunity to engage them emotionally, by telling a powerful story that is relevant to her theme.<br /><br />You have the same opportunity. Consider the message you are trying to get across. What problem does it solve? What's the human dimension? Who does it remind you of? Once you have the seeds of a story, practice telling and retelling it until you it makes you laugh, cringe, groan, flinch or grin as you speak. When it affects you like this, it will move your audience too.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.duarte.com/">Nancy Duarte</a>'s new book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Resonate-Present-Stories-Transform-Audiences/dp/0470632011/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307532884&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Resonate</em></a>, will show you how to entrance audiences with storytelling.<br /><br /><strong>4. Wow them with words.</strong><br />You should never try to get your presentation word perfect, by memorizing every single word - that will only make for stilted delivery. But it does pay to sprinkle it with a few choice phrases and add the odd rhetorical flourish. <br /><br />It's true that "statistics can be misleading," but saying it like that won't get people to sit up straight. Try injecting a little more originality:<br /><br /><span class="pullquote">"There are three kinds of lies. Lies, damned lies, and statistics." -Benjamin Disraeli</span><br />For a concise guide to emulating the verbal eloquence of great speakers, read chapter 4 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.speaking.co.uk/">Max Atkinson</a>'s book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Speech-making-Presentation-Made-Easy-ebook/dp/B004E10RQS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A7B2F8DUJ88VZ&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1307532964&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Speech-making and Presentation Made Easy</em></a>.<br /><br /><strong>5. Create stunning slides.</strong><br />Slides are optional, but if you're going to use them, make them great. Even if you're not a graphic designer, it's relatively easy to stand out from the crowd of bullet points and PowerPoint templates, by licensing high-quality images from stock sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">istockphoto</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.veer.com">Veer</a>, or searching for Creative Commons-licensed photos from Flickr using <a target="_blank" href="http://compfight.com/">Compfight</a> (just make sure you read the licensing terms carefully, especially for commercial use!). And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Garr Reynolds</a>' book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Design-Principles-Presentations/dp/0321668790/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307533937&amp;sr=8-2"><em>Presentation Zen Design</em></a> will introduce you to basic design principles for creating slides from the images.<br /><br />And if you are a graphic designer, check out Nancy Duarte's beautiful book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/slide-ology-Science-Creating-Presentations/dp/0596522347/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307533150&amp;sr=8-3"><em>Slide:ology</em></a>, for a stimulating guide to the creative possibilities of slide design. Nancy and her team designed the slides for Al Gore's "Inconvenient Truth" presentation and feature film, so she knows a thing or two about creating slides with impact.<br /><br /><strong>6. Keep it simple.</strong><br />Simplicity - focusing on core themes and eliminating fluff - is the key to a lot of great design, great writing, great music, great dance, and great art of many kinds. It's also one of the things that makes presentations powerful and memorable.<br /><br />This is all you need for a truly great presentation:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>One big idea</li>
<li>Three key points</li>
<li>One compelling story</li>
<li>One idea per slide (and <a target="_blank" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/really_bad_powe.html">no more than six words</a>)</li>
<li>One clear call to action</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br />As with any other creative project you've executed, the challenge is to pare it down to the essentials, using your <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6971/Why-Your-Inner-Critic-Is-Your-Best-Friend">critical thinking skills</a>.<br /><br />Looking at the list, you can see it's made up of the core skills of creative professionals: crafting messages; organizing information; telling stories; choosing words carefully; and creating striking visuals. You probably don't have all of these skills, but I'm sure you have at least one or two. Start with these, then work to acquire the others using the resources I've listed. <br /><br />For example, I'm pretty good with words, and telling stories is second nature to me, but I had to study to learn how to develop visually striking slides. But if you're a designer, you can give yourself a head start on other presenters by creating a remarkable slide deck, which will boost your confidence - then start working on your verbal delivery and storytelling.<br /><br />The ultimate test will be your audience's response. But a sure sign that you're on the right track will be when you start looking forward to creating your next presentation...</div>

You take pride in your ability to deal with a hefty workload and numerous deadlines without getting tripped up along the way. Yet, no matter how accomplished and efficient you are, there will be times when you get overwhelmed by negative or upsetting events.</div>
<div>Times when you are left wondering how you could possibly accomplish almost anything in the near term &ndash; be it the client work that still needs to be completed on time, or the myriad of other commitments and responsibilities crying out for your attention. So what happens when your productivity fails you?<br /><br />As hopeless as it may feel, there are very practical things you can do during such times to keep going:<br /><br /><strong>1. Acknowledge that the normal rules don't apply for the time being.</strong> You might normally plough through half of your lengthy to-do list by lunchtime, but now you are having trouble motivating to complete even the smallest of tasks. Rather than deny that reality, accept it and make some temporary adjustments as recommended below.<br /><br /><strong>2. Focus on the essential tasks, and cut back on everything else. </strong>Your essentials are not your &ldquo;Should-Do List,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s your &ldquo;Must-Do-To-Survive List.&rdquo; (If there was ever a time to follow the advice <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6945/If-It-Wont-Fit-On-A-Post-It-It-Wont-Fit-In-Your-Day">here</a>, now is that time.) If you need to fly out to a family funeral tomorrow, it&rsquo;s hopeless (and unhealthy) to try and squeeze all of your normal tasks in and around that event. Put those normal activities on hold, and deal with the flight and what comes immediately after it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Your essentials are not your &lsquo;Should-Do List,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s your &lsquo;Must-Do-To-Survive List.&rsquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3. Make sure you get a lot of rest. </strong>When you&rsquo;re already stressed about not having enough time to get everything done, resting can feel counter-intuitive. But if you don&rsquo;t get enough rest, the situation can quickly escalate from bad to worse. Instead of being so sick that you can barely take a call lying down, you might find yourself in the hospital. Nourishing your body &ndash; and pacing yourself &ndash; is extremely important if you want to be as productive as possible during a difficult time.<br /><br /><strong>4. Ask for help. </strong>Even if you pare your workload down to the absolute minimum, you may still find yourself falling behind. Do the obvious (but sometimes challenging) thing, and ask for help: Delegate work to your co-workers and tap your family and friends for assistance. Your true allies will be happy to help you when you&rsquo;re in a hard spot: Give them the chance to do some good, and they will.<br /><br /><strong>5. Focus on the positive as much as possible. </strong>We often make the mistake of shutting out the positive as we wrestle with the negative. Try not to give in to this. Hearing those who are close to you say that you are doing well under the circumstances can be a relief. Don&rsquo;t be shy: If you need a morale boost, kindly request one. You know who is likely to provide such comfort, why not ask them for it?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Your true allies will be happy to help you when you&rsquo;re in a hard spot: Give them the chance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>6. Reboot yourself. </strong>When it looks like the hard times are letting up, seize the moment and decide how you can do things better going forward. If you were very ill, ask yourself how you can improve your health once you are feeling better. Perhaps it&rsquo;s starting a new fitness routine, resetting your work-life balance, or allocating more time to your family, your friends, and yourself. If you had a work-related crisis, it might be time to reassess why you do what you do, and realign how you spend your time and energy.<br /><br /><strong>7. Say thank you. </strong>After the clouds pass and the sun begins to shine again, don&rsquo;t forget about the people who helped in your time of need. Make it a priority to pay back those debts, financial and personal, that you might have drawn on during your difficult time. There are few investments that will pay such good dividends as offering a tangible expression of gratitude to those who took care of you.<br /><br />--<br /><strong>What Do You Do In Crisis?</strong><br /><br />How have you dealt with unexpected negative events that impacted your work? Do you have any tips to share?</div>

How Do Maverick Geniuses Get Created?</strong></span></a><br />Since it was founded in 1861, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has boasted a stunning capacity to produce graduates who go on to found profitable, innovative companies. &ldquo;If the MIT was a country, it would have the 11th highest GDP of any nation in the world.&rdquo; In this piece, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/may/18/mit-massachusetts-150-years-genius"><em>The Guardian</em></a> takes a look at what gives MIT an edge. Not surprisingly the school's curriculum focuses on doing, not dreaming: <br /><span class="pullquote">From the moment MIT was founded by William Barton Rogers in 1861 it was clear what it was not. It was not like the other school up the river. While Harvard stuck to the English model of an Oxbridge classical education, with its emphasis on Latin and Greek as befitted the landed aristocracy, MIT would look to the German system of learning based onresearch&nbsp;and hands-on experimentation, championing meritocracy and industry where Harvard preferred the privileges of birth. Knowledge was at a premium, yes, but it had to be useful.</span></div>

<div><br />Steve on managing your start-up anxiety:<br /><span class="pullquote">Whenever people ask me how I make it through, I always say the same thing. &nbsp;Sit down and write down the shit storms that you are worrying about and divide them into two list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that are under your control and those that aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then focus on the list that you can control.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stare at that list long enough you&rsquo;ll realize a commonality.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the solution to every single one of them begins with having a team that is rock solid, one that isn't afraid of challenges and one that believes in you as a founder. &nbsp;If you do this one thing right, it will steady you and calm your mind enough to face and conquer any challenge. </span></div>

Our greatest strokes of luck often come through random connections, and this list is all about pushing outside of your comfort zone to spark even more ideas, connections, and relationships.</div>
<div><br />Some of my favorites:<br /><span class="pullquote">1. Go to the nearest magazine shop. Now. Spend 20 minutes. Pick up 20 &mdash; twenty! &mdash; magazines. None should be ones you normally read. Spend the better part of a day perusing them. Tear stuff out. Make notes. Create files. Goal: Stretch! Repeat . . . monthly . . . or at least bi-monthly.<br /><br />18. A crummy little assignment comes along. But it would give you a chance to work with a group of people you&rsquo;ve never worked with before. Take the assignment.<br /><br />34. Institute a monthly Brown Bag Lunch Session. Encourage all your colleagues to nominate interesting people to be invited. Criterion: "I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected us to invite &mdash; &mdash; ."<br /><br />36. Consider a . . . four-month sabbatical.</span></div>

Roseanne Barr on How Hollywood Really Works</strong></span></a><br />One of the month&rsquo;s most unexpected gems was a tell-all piece by comedian Roseanne Barr about the making of her runaway hit sitcom, <em>Roseanne</em>. The eye-opening essay provides an excoriating account of how Hollywood really works (at least from Roseanne&rsquo;s perspective), and she doesn&rsquo;t shy away from taboo topics.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Roseanne Barr on her first disillusionment:</div>
<div><span class="pullquote">It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to get a taste of the staggering sexism and class bigotry that would make the first season of Roseanne god-awful. It was at the premiere party when I learned that my stories and ideas&mdash;and the ideas of my sister and my first husband, Bill&mdash;had been stolen. The pilot was screened, and I saw the opening credits for the first time, which included this: CREATED BY MATT WILLIAMS. I was devastated and felt so betrayed that I stood up and left the party. Not one person noticed.</span></div>

When a customer took our Action Sheets and retrofitted them for a Levenger Circa notebook, we took note, and a great collaboration was born: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Action-Circa-Notebook/23">The Action Circa</a>, a new fully customizable notebook from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.behance.com">Behance</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.levenger.com/">Levenger</a>.</span>To coincide with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Action-Circa-Notebook/23">Action Circa launch</a>, I sat down with Levenger CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.wellreadlife.com/">Steve Leveen</a> to talk about what he&rsquo;s learned about organization and productivity in 24 years of business, the genesis of the original Circa idea, the writing habits of great authors, and, of course, what he&rsquo;s reading.<br /><br /><strong>Where did the inspiration to start Levenger come from?</strong><br />My wife and I started the business in our townhouse in Boston, just outside in Belmont. We catered to readers. And as far as I know, we were the first company to cater to readers with products other than publications, with gear. We started with lighting for reading. We expanded from that into furniture, then leather goods, and paper products and pens.</div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;">Steve at his desk.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How did you identify the need to move into organizational products?</strong><br />From the very beginning, what we noticed in our own home was it was hard to find a really nice place to sit and read. Lighting was an issue back then. What we discovered when we looked for lamps in the lighting stores was that no one really paid any attention to the functionality of lighting, only to the aesthetics &ndash; what color is the shade, and does it fit in your d&eacute;cor. That sort of thing. <br /><br />Being serious about our reading and our work, we were looking for more than that. So that&rsquo;s how we started in business. I had to go out and research lighting and learn about the geometry of lighting and light bulbs and color temperature and veiling glare &ndash; the technical aspects of lighting for working. Consumers didn&rsquo;t have much access to this information. If they were lucky, they worked in an office that was well-designed from a lighting point of view, but most homes were not.</div>
<div><br />So we started with lighting and then we realized that there were other aspects of reading and writing and working with ideas where the tools mattered. The quality of the paper, the design of the paper, the quality of the writing implements. Your chair, your footrest, the desk you&rsquo;re using.</div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;">Detail of the Action Circa Notebook disc technology.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Where did the idea for the Circa notebooks come from?</strong><br />The basic idea of a disc-bound notebook has been around since just after WWII. The first patents were, I think, in Belgium around the late 1940s. The notebooks have been around in Europe and in Asia, South America, and the United States. As far as I know, Levenger is the first company to take the disc-bound notebooks and show the real potential of what could be done &ndash; because it&rsquo;s not something that leaps off the shelf and people understand the benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">We realized that there were other aspects of reading and writing and working with ideas where the tools mattered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It was only once we combined it &ndash; the disc-bound concept &ndash; with really high-quality paper and materials, and what we call &ldquo;action figures sold separately&rdquo; &ndash; all the tabs and the folders, etc &ndash; did we realized how cool it could be. And, what&rsquo;s really most important, how individualized it could be. We&rsquo;ve sold hundreds of thousands of Circa notebooks now, and I know that no two are alike in the way that they&rsquo;re actually used by our customers. So it&rsquo;s really kind of exciting to see how paper notebooks can get better and better, and dance with digital technology. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s funny how we&rsquo;re starting to use our notebooks a little bit more like computers, moving things around with fluidity. For instance, Tom Kelley at IDEO uses Circa notebooks to write his books. I mean, here&rsquo;s a guy who lives design, and can have any technology that he wants, and he likes the combination of advanced paper technology with computers.</div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;">The Action Circa Notebook.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Do you know specifically what his process is?</strong><br />He uses the junior size notebooks in the grid format. And he tells stories, one idea per page, in as many different notebooks as he needs for different chapters. He wrote <em>The Ten Faces of Innovation</em> using a bunch of Circa notebooks &ndash; one for each chapter. <br /><br /><strong>I still do most of my writing in longhand, too. There&rsquo;s something nice about not being tied to a computer.</strong><br />I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. So does Stacy Schiff. And so does Pat Conroy &ndash; I just read his book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Reading-Life-Pat-Conroy/dp/0385533578"><em>My Reading Life</em></a>, and he writes on yellow legal pads. And let&rsquo;s not forget David McCullough, who writes on his 1940s Royal typewriter. People told him he could write faster on a computer, and he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to write any faster.&rdquo; You may know we reproduced that typewriter as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.levenger.com/pagetemplates/product/product.asp?params=category=17-805|level=2-3|pageid=7242">bookend</a> and to my surprise and delight it sells really well.<br /><br /><strong>What&rsquo;s your system on a personal level for tracking your to-dos?</strong><br />I use a Circa notebook. I use many of them, but my main one is a letter size with a prototype cover on. My first tab division is called &ldquo;Capture,&rdquo; where I write down anything I have to do, most of which I can do in two minutes. And then I have a tab with just plain paper, so all I have to do is open up the tab and I have a blank sheet ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Then I have my &ldquo;Projects,&rdquo; that are small enough to keep in my main notebook. Once they morph into something bigger then they go elsewhere, and I have separate notebooks for important projects. I have &ldquo;References&rdquo; in the back, and it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.<br /><br /><strong>What do you think are the keys to staying organized and productive?</strong><br />I think that it&rsquo;s important to have one drawer that&rsquo;s totally organized with all the tools you use all the time. And also to have at least one drawer that&rsquo;s a complete mess &ndash; that you put all your stuff that you don&rsquo;t want to see on your desk.<br /><br />At home and at work, I have a drawer that&rsquo;s organized exactly the same way. You know, sort of like a paramedic might organize surgical tools. And I can open this drawer right now, and I know exactly where everything is.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">It&rsquo;s important to have one drawer that&rsquo;s totally organized with all the tools you use all the time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also like what we call tabula rasa, which is just a big, open desk. You know, people can fall into the trap where you start using working surfaces for storage. And you get these stacks all over the place, and that can kind of wear on you. I think it&rsquo;s important to have one table that has nothing on it at all, so when you decide to work on a task, you can put it there, and have a clean slate, or tabula rasa.</div>

<div><strong>Do you have any best practices on time management?</strong><br />I do get up early, and my morning time is really sacrosanct with me. If I have any writing to do, that&rsquo;s when I do it. I try never to write after 5 o&rsquo;clock, and certainly not after 9pm. The evening hours for me are a great time to watch movies, or just hang out with people. The most intense mental activity, writing or creating, I reserve for the morning, and I work at home for a few hours before I go to work.</div>
<div><br /> <strong>When do you get up?</strong><br />Usually by 5am. I enjoy my first cup of coffee, and it&rsquo;s just me and the dog and the house is quiet. That&rsquo;s a real special time in my day. I also exercise most everyday, which is kind of an important thing. I find that I try never to think about work or ideas when I exercise, but frequently good ideas occur to me despite that. <br /><br />I am a believer in an early morning schedule. Though I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an ironclad rule that works for everyone. There are nightowls and there are larks, and I just happen to be a lark.<br /><br /><strong>You&rsquo;re obviously a big reader. What have you been reading lately?</strong><br />I&rsquo;m more a wannabe reader than an actual reader. I did finish <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Super-Sad-True-Love-Story/dp/1400066409"><em>Super Sad True Love Story</em></a> [by Gary Shteyngart] &ndash; it&rsquo;s scary but good &ndash; especially for a New Yorker. I would recommend it. That&rsquo;s a great one on the fiction side.<br /><br />On non-fiction, I read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Succeed-Revised/dp/0143117009/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307045663&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Collapse</em></a> by Jared Diamond, which is a sobering but incredibly important book. And on the history side I read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Tycoon-Cornelius-Vanderbilt-Vintage/dp/1400031745/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307045686&amp;sr=1-1"><em>The First Tycoon: The epic life of Cornelius Vanderbilt</em></a>. A great epic history.</div>

To answer questions like: How do creative projects really get pushed forward? What tools are you using to manage your time and energy? And: Are the ways we live and work as creative professionals undergoing major changes? </span>Then we crunched all of the data and transformed it into a <a target="_blank" href="http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/e2/99/pdf/idea_execution_2011.pdf">gorgeous, poster-size infographic</a> sponsored by BlackBerry, which we premiered at our annual <a href="http://the99percent.com/conference">99% Conference</a> just a few weeks ago.<br /><br />So what does idea execution look like? Below we share our thoughts on some of the more unexpected and intriguing survey results.</div>
<div><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Email Is Our Biggest Distraction<br /></strong></span></div>
<div><br /><img title="email_550" alt="email_550" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/email_550.png" height="309" width="550" /><br /><br /></div>
<div>Respondents said that over 60% of their communication took place over email or instant message, outpacing face-to-face conversations (22%) by almost 3 to 1. At the same time, email was ALSO listed as the number one distraction from getting work done, with Facebook as a distant runner-up.<br /><br />Therein lies the crux of the email problem. It's become THE go-to communication tool, but it's also a huge productivity drain -- which is why having an <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/browse/78/Email-Strategy">email management strategy</a> has become so crucial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solo Entrepreneurs &amp; Home Offices on the Rise</strong></span><br /><br /><img title="office_550" alt="office_550" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/office_550.png" height="297" width="550" /><br /><br /></div>
<div>We also confirmed our suspicions that: a) the co-working movement is seriously gaining steam within the creative professional community, and b) the creative workforce, in general, is becoming more mobile and fragmented. According to our poll, the home office (38%) is now almost as popular as the company office (49%) among creatives.<br /><br />While this flexibility and freedom is -- of course -- awesome, it's also a great argument for honing our <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/browse/1/Organization">organizational skills</a>. As the typical big company bureaucracy breaks down, independent workers will have more and more administrative-type details to manage -- on top of being creative geniuses!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Best Insights Come During Downtime</strong></span><br /><br /><img title="breaks_550" alt="breaks_550" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/breaks_550.png" height="287" width="550" /><br /><br /></div>
<div>As we discussed in a recent article on <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7034/Developing-Your-Creative-Practice-Tips-from-Brian-Eno">Brian Eno's creative process</a>, it's not uncommon for great ideas to strike when we're taking a break. The 2011 Idea Execution Audit results confirmed that stepping away from our desks -- both to recharge and let our minds wander -- is as valuable as slogging away at the computer.<br /><br />While we're not suggesting you switch your work regime to all naps and strolls and daydreaming, it's worth noting that <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/browse/68/Recharging">energy renewal</a> is as closely related to making ideas happen as "keeping busy."<a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6985/How-To-Control-Your-Check-In-Addiction"></a></div>

After focusing intently on a project or problem, the brain needs to fully disengage and relax in order for a &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; moment to arise. It&rsquo;s often the mundane activities like taking a shower, driving, or taking a walk that lure great ideas to the surface. Composer Steve Reich, for instance, would ride the subway around New York when he was stuck.</span>Science journalist Jonah Lehrer, referencing a landmark neuroscience study on brain activity during innovation, <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/ekmiller/Public/www/miller/News_Articles/Lehrer_Insight_New_Yorker.pdf">writes</a>:<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;The relaxation phase is crucial. That&rsquo;s why so many insights happen during warm showers. &hellip; One of the surprising lessons of this research is that trying to force an insight can actually prevent the insight.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The ebb and flow of concentrated focus and total disengagement has been a subject of particular interest to the composer, musician, and producer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno</a> (U2, Talking Heads, Roxy Music). Drawing on interviews from throughout Eno&rsquo;s career, Eric Tamm&rsquo;s book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.erictamm.com/tammeno.html"><em>Brian Eno: His Music and The Vertical Sound of Color</em></a>, delves deeply into Eno&rsquo;s &ldquo;creative process.&rdquo; Eno himself calls it:</div>
<div><br /><span class="pullquote">...a practice of some kind ... It quite frequently happens that you&rsquo;re just treading water for quite a long time. Nothing really dramatic seems to be happening. &hellip; And then suddenly everything seems to lock together in a different way. It&rsquo;s like a crystallization point where you can&rsquo;t detect any single element having changed. There&rsquo;s a proverb that says that the fruit takes a long time to ripen, but it falls suddenly ... And that seems to be the process.</span></div>
<div><br />While neuroscience hasn&rsquo;t yet been able to develop a foolproof scientific system to spark creativity, an artistic practice, if developed, can grease the wheels for more frequent and higher quality creative moments. As Eno puts it: &ldquo;The point about working is not to produce great stuff all the time, but to remain ready for when you can.&rdquo; He continues:</div>
<div><br /><span class="pullquote">There&rsquo;s no point in saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have an idea today, so I&rsquo;ll just smoke some drugs.&rsquo; You should stay alert for the moment when a number of things are just ready to collide with one another... The reason to keep working is almost to build a certain mental tone, like people talk about body tone. You have to move quickly when the time comes, and the time might come very infrequently &ndash; once or twice a year, or even less.</span><br />Craft, he says, &ldquo;enables you to be successful when you&rsquo;re not inspired.&rdquo; He goes on:</div>
<div><br /><span class="pullquote">The difficulty of always feeling that you ought to be doing something is that you tend to undervalue the times when you&rsquo;re apparently doing nothing, and those are very important times. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of the dream time, in your daily life, times when things get sorted out and reshuffled. If you&rsquo;re constantly awake work-wise you don&rsquo;t allow that to happen. One of the reasons I have to take distinct breaks when I work is to allow the momentum of a particular direction to run down, so that another one can establish itself.</span><br />Throughout his career, Eno has used a grab bag of tools to assist the creative process. &ldquo;There are lots of ways that you can interfere with it and make it more efficient.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>1. Freeform capture. </strong>Grab from a range of sources without editorializing. According to Tamm, one of Eno&rsquo;s tactics &ldquo;involves keeping a microcassette tape recorder on hand at all times and recording any stray ideas that hit him out of the blue &ndash; a melody, a rhythm, a verbal phrase.&rdquo; He&rsquo;ll then go through and look for links or connections, something that can form the foundation for a new piece of music.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>2. Blank state. </strong>Start with new tools, from nothing, and toy around. For example, Eno approaches this by entering the recording studio with no preconceived ideas, only a set of instruments or a few musicians and &ldquo;just dabble with sounds until something starts to happen that suggests a texture.&rdquo; When the sound texture evokes a memory or emotion that impression then takes over in guiding the process.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>3. Deliberate limitations.</strong> Before a project begins, develop specific limitations. Eno&rsquo;s example: &ldquo;this piece is going to be three minutes and nineteen seconds long and it&rsquo;s going to have changes here, here and here, and there&rsquo;s going to be a convolution of events here, and there&rsquo;s going to be a very fast rhythm here with a very slow moving part over the top of it.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>4. Opposing forces. </strong>Sometimes it&rsquo;s best to generate a forced collision of ideas. Eno would &ldquo;gather together a group of musicians who wouldn&rsquo;t normally work together.&rdquo; Dissimilar background and approaches can often evoke fresh thinking.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>5. Creative prompts. </strong>In the &lsquo;70s Eno developed his <a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/5062659/oblique-strategies-on-your-iphone">Oblique Strategies</a> cards, a series of prompts modeled after the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">I Ching</a> to disrupt the process and encourage a new way of encountering a creative problem. On the cards are statements and questions like: &ldquo;Would anybody want it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Try faking it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Only a part, not the whole.&rdquo; &ldquo;Work at a different speed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Disconnect from desire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Turn it upside down.&rdquo; &ldquo;Use an old idea.&rdquo; These prompts are a method of generating specifics, which most creatives respond favorably to.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the end, don&rsquo;t underestimate your personal feelings about a project. Eno states: &ldquo;Nearly all the things I do that are of any merit at all start off as just being good fun.&rdquo; Amen to that.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.erictamm.com/tammeno.html">--&gt; Download Eric Tamm&rsquo;s Brian Eno e-book for free </a></div>

If I start editing a paper, for example, I have to spend at least 30 minutes editing. If I need to complete a small task, like handing in a form, I have to spend at least 30 minutes doing small tasks. Crucially, checking email and looking up information online count as small tasks. If I need to check my inbox or grab a quick stat from the web, I have to spend at least 30 minutes dedicated to similarly small diversions.</span>I followed these rules for one full work day. This post describes why I did it and what I learned.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Continuous Partial Attention</strong></span><br /><br />The motivation for my experiment should sound familiar. Over the past half-decade, researchers have been sounding the alarm on the dangers of multitasking. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/Home_page/Welcome.html">Gloria Mark</a>, for example, a professor at the University of California at Irvine, <a target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E3DD163FF935A25753C1A9639C8B63">found that the technology workers she studied</a> would make it, on average, only 11 minutes into a project before being distracted. It then took 25 minutes to return to the task post-distraction.<br /><br />For some jobs, where responsiveness is crucial, this work style might be necessary. But as an academic, I'm a <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6956/Getting-Creative-Things-Done-How-To-Fit-Hard-Thinking-Into-a-Busy-Schedule">to-do list creative</a> -- to keep my job, I have to keep up with logistical tasks, but to advance, I need long bouts of focus on hard problems. For a to-do list creative, ignoring the small stuff isn't an option, but living in a state of <em>continuous partial attention</em> (to steal a phrase from <a target="_blank" href="http://lindastone.net/">Linda Stone</a>) won't cut it either.<br /><br />The solution to this quandary is well-known by now: batching.<em> </em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Check email only a small number of times per day! Work in big chunks without distraction!</em><br /><br />Everyone has heard this suggestion. But almost no one follows it.<br /><br />This is why I launched my experiment. I wanted to see what would happen if I <em>forced</em> myself to batch.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Ignoring the small stuff isn't an option, but living in a state of continuous partial attention won't cut it either.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Day of Forced Batching</strong></span><br /><br />I have a doctors appointment scheduled for 10 a.m., so I decide to focus on a writing project from 8 to 10.<br /><br />I feel the normal temptation to check my email while writing -- <em>just in case</em> -- but my rules forbid it. Even a glance at my inbox would trigger at least 30 minutes of similar small tasks.<br /><br />When I arrive at my appointment at 10, I discover I had the wrong time. The appointment is not until 11.<br /><br />My rules force me to think in blocks of 30 minutes or more, so I decide to spend from 10 to 10:30 contininuing work on my writing project at a nearby library. Then, from 10:30 to 11:00, I do my first small tasks block of the day. I have high hopes during this first small task block that I will efficiently knock off many items from my logistical backlog. Instead, I end up bogged down in my email inbox, trying to sort through who needs what and when.<br /><br />After my appointment, I head home, go for a run, and make myself lunch.<br /><br />It's now 1:30 and I'm in a tight spot. My goal for the afternoon is to continue work on an important research problem. To do so, I need to retrieve the latest draft of our write-up from my email. But this will require a small task block of at least 30 minutes, so I have to be careful about how and when I do this.<br /><br />Even more tricky, I need to meet with my collaborator to help work through some kinks in the research problem. On a normal day, I might send him an email saying, "when can you meet?", and then just keep my inbox open until he responds. My rules, however, forbid this strategy (that is, unless I want to dedicate my entire afternoon to checking my inbox and similar small tasks).<br /><br />I come up with the following solution:<br /><br />I convert my commute from my apartment back to campus into a small task block. That is, I will retrieve the write-up draft and check my email right before I leave my apartment. I will think through my emails and how to respond while traveling. Then when I arrive at my office, I'll send off those replies and shut down the small task block.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">I feel the normal temptation to check my email while writing - <em>just in case</em> - but my rules forbid it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To handle my meeting dilemma, I send my collaborator an email that reads: "During the following times this afternoon I'll be working on this&nbsp; project, if you happen to be free anytime in here, stop by my office,&nbsp; otherwise tell me some times when we might meet tomorrow and I will get back to you at the end of the day to fix one."&nbsp; I've now freed myself from needing to keep my inbox open during the afternoon.<br /><br />From 2 to 5:30 I'm working on my research problem. The rules remove any possibility of distraction -- <em>no matter how brief</em> -- and this seems to improve my focus. "There's a real sense of momentum here," I write in my notes.<br /><br />At 5:30, I decide to do one final small task block to shut down my day. I treat this like a challenge: <em>how much can I squeeze into one 30-minute block? </em>The time constraint provides a certain urgency to my actions usually lacking at 5:30 in the evening. I end up finishing my work emails for the day, answering some blog reader emails, paying the rent, approving a design concept, sending a message to a pair of old friends, planning the next day, and recording the notes from this experiment.<br /><br />In the end, the momentum carries me past 6:00 and I end up finishing closer to 6:30. This is later than I normally like to work, but the day ends with a satisfying feeling of accomplishment.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusions</strong></span><br /><br /><em>I'll start with the negative aspects of this experiment:</em><br /><br />Batching, as it turns out, is hard.<br /><br />It requires that you plan ahead to make sure you have the material and information needed for focused blocks. It also requires careful communication. Answering emails, for example, is complicated when you need those emails to include all of the information needed for the next actions to be taken. (It's much easier to use email for informal back and forth dialogue.)&nbsp; Because of this, tackling my inbox during the experiment was surprisingly draining.<br /><br />In other words, batching requires more work than not batching. This is why, I now understand, most people are quick to abandon their good-natured attempts to enforce more focus in their day: once it becomes non-obvious how to continue, they toss the goal.<br /><br /><em>But then there are the positives:</em><br /><br />Having a clear rule that forbids <em>any</em> distraction during focused work was freeing. I still felt drawn toward diversion, but knowing that acquiescence was not even a possibility reduced its urgency.<br /><br />On the flip side, the percentage of time spent in a flow state was as large as I've experienced in recent memory. I ended up spending 2.5 hours focused on my writing project and 3.5 hours focused on my research paper. That's six hours, in one day, of focused work with <em>zero</em> interruptions; not even one quick glance at email.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Having a clear rule that forbids <em>any</em> distraction during focused work was freeing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At the same time, the careful pre-planning required to satisfy my batching rules increased the efficiency of my small task completion. Even though I dedicated 6 hours in one 10 hour work day to uninterrupted focus, another 1.5 hours to exercise and eating, and another 1 hour to a doctors appointment, I still managed to accomplish an impressive collection of logistical tasks both urgent and non-urgent.<br /><br /><em>My bottom line:</em><br /><br />To do batching right requires the type of strict rules I deployed in my experiment. These rules, as I discovered, will absolutely make your day more difficult. There's no avoiding the reality that there will be times when you have to take convoluted action to solve a problem that could so easily be handled with just a quick bounce over to your inbox.<br /><br />This is a pain in the ass.<br /><br />At the same time, however, if you survive the annonyance, there's also no avoiding the reality that your work will be of a much higher quality.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is the batching trade-off: inconvenience in your daily workflow in exchange for an increased quality of your work.<br /><br />From my experience writing about productivity, most people will abandon a tactic as soon as it makes their life more difficult. My experience with batching, however, leads me to question whether we need to rethink where we place our emphasis.</div>

Like <a href="http://the99percent.com/">99%</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.actionmethod.com/">Action Method</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.behance.net">Behance Network</a>, we created ProSite to empower the careers of creative professionals. </span>So what&rsquo;s revolutionary about ProSite? To explain our vision, we should first delve for a quick moment into the history of how creatives have presented their work. <br /><br /><br /><img title="self_presentation_550_01" alt="self_presentation_550_01" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/self_presentation_550_01.jpg" height="410" width="550" /><br /><br /><br />In the olden days, creatives lugged around &ldquo;The Book,&rdquo; a physical portfolio that was sent around to headhunters and prospective clients whenever an opportunity presented itself. These books were expensive, heavy, and outdated from the moment they were sent.<br /><br />In recent years, most creative professionals have transformed their portfolio book into a stand-alone website. The stand-alone web portfolio has offered some efficiencies, but fundamental challenges remain: As with old-school portfolio books, you still need to invite, or drive, people to view your site. As we all know, &ldquo;If you build it, they will come&rdquo; is not always entirely true. And what if you don&rsquo;t know how to code a website in the first place?!<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.prosite.com">ProSite</a> introduces a new concept tailored to the modern creative professional: A connected portfolio website that&rsquo;s fully customizable, with no coding required.</strong></div>
<div><br /><br /></div>
<div><img title="99_prosite_02" alt="99_prosite_02" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/99_prosite_02.jpg" height="370" width="550" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>So how did we make ProSite happen?</strong><br /><br />At the outset of an intense design and development process, we established a handful of elements that we deemed essential to creating our vision of the &ldquo;connected portfolio.&rdquo; These are the objectives that guided our decisions as we developed ProSite:<br /><br /><strong>1. Advanced Customization, No Coding Necessary</strong><br />We wanted ProSite to accommodate creative professionals regardless of their web programming knowledge. We wanted enough simplicity to empower a creative with absolutely no knowledge of web coding, while also offering enough customization options to please the most advanced designers. While developing the features, we were very focused on streamlining the website creation process. You can create a ProSite in 2 minutes or spend days customizing it.<br /><br /><strong>2. A &ldquo;Connected&rdquo; Portfolio, In-Sync With Behance, LinkedIn, &amp; More</strong><br />ProSite seamlessly syncs your online portfolio with the Behance Network, allowing you to create and manage your entire online presence from one central place. By integrating ProSite with the Behance Network, we also empower you to broadcast your work with a single click to a variety of other platforms, including LinkedIn, AIGA, AdWeek, and more.<br /><br /><strong>3. Integrate The Best Social Promotion &amp; Marketing Tools On The Web</strong><br />A great creative career requires a marketing strategy and tools to maximize exposure and opportunity. We wanted to make sure that every project you upload has the full range of social promotion options including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and StumbleUpon among others. We also built in analytics and SEO tools to help user websites get found in search engines.<br /><br /><strong>4. Save Creative Professionals Time &amp; Money</strong><br />We wanted to save creative professionals TIME. Time is our most precious commodity, and we developed ProSite to reduce the time spent maintaining your personal website by 90%. <br /><br />We also wanted ProSite to provide the very best hosting and support at an extremely affordable cost. Behance has invested many years in developing a large hosting infrastructure, redundant systems to ensure uptime, and services that keep your website fast and secure. ProSite offers it all for $11/month (or $8.25/month with the annual plan). <br /><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">***</div>

It&rsquo;s no secret that kids and adults alike are much more engaged when playing video games than they are when they're doing humdrum daily tasks. So how can game dynamics be applied to our everyday lives and creative endeavors?</div>

<div><strong><a href="http://the99percent.com/conference/speakers/jared_cohen"><br />JARED COHEN /// Director, Google Ideas</a></strong><br />Jared Cohen, a former State Department employee, is the director of Google Ideas, loosely framed as Google&rsquo;s "think/do tank." Interested in the causes of radicalization, Cohen has traveled extensively in the Middle East and South America, at times interviewing terrorists, to help &ldquo;foster an intellectual collision&rdquo; surrounding radicalization. He brought his expertise to The 99% to help us understand how technology impacts youth identity, and how pursuing controversial ideas can work in our favor.</div>

<div><strong><a href="http://the99percent.com/conference/speakers/starlee_kine">STARLEE KINE /// Radio Producer &amp; Writer</a></strong><br />Just after Cohen, radio producer and writer Starlee Kine, a veteran of NPR's <em>This American Life</em>, took the stage. As one attendee commented, "listening to Starlee Kine is like sitting on a couch with her." In narrating her trials and tribulations (including a memorable phone call/songwriting lesson with Phil Collins), she spoke about finding ideas in everyday experiences and learning how to stay motivated to see them through.</div>
