Inject a copyright notice into the footer.

== Description ==

Blog Copyright injects a copyright notice into the blog footer. You can see it in action on this very site. The copyright notice automatically updates the year range as time goes one removing the need to ever revisit your copyright once the plugin is put in placeâ€¦ Adjustments can be made to a variety of options including the starting year and the rights reserved statement.
