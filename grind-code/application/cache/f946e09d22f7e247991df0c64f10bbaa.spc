We work in front of screens, we're entertained by screens, there are screens in elevators and schools, and we carry screens in our pocket for the times between other screens. We are constantly and conveniently entertained, updated, and connected. Screens have become our closest companion, our friend, and our babysitter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The problem is that these new media have made it easier for us to get sidetracked and distracted from the meaningful experiences of our lives. They become addictive and compulsive, and are, as embarrassing as it is to say, designed to be so. Pavlov-like, we check and recheck emails, keep up our online status and waste time with Solitaire and Angry Birds.</div>
<div><br />Heck, as I write this the cute couple at the next table are paying more attention to their phones than to each other. Do we really need to text while walking? Can you walk your dog and not bring your phone? We have become so obsessed with our tools that we feel lost without them.</div>

<div class="blockquote">These new media have made it easier for us to get sidetracked and distracted from the meaningful experiences of our lives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is no longer a time and a place for a phone call. The emails, chats, texts, games, pads, pods, and clouds have become a leash jerking us out of our quiet time. They demand our attention, but limit our focus, leaving us no time for reflection, contemplation, study, or the solitude necessary for deep thought and not just a temporary and shallow retreat.<br /><br />Our brains are being rewired. There is no longer a difference between "urgent" and "important."&nbsp; We're learning new habits and sadly forgetting the instincts we were born with. We hand off our iPhones to toddlers, so that we are relieved from the duty of parenting. Thus our kids never learn to handle boredom. We are led off the path and, worse, we gladly pay monthly for this servitude.</div>

<div>Don't get me wrong, I love the tools. Hurrah for the Future! Going backwards is not the answer. The answer is being conscious of the time spent on screens versus the time spent on ourselves. Can you create more time in your life? Time to plan and organize your life? Can you make more time to give to others? The answers are discipline, etiquette, and understanding the importance of time in our lives.<br /><br />Every time I return from vacation I have to ask myself, "Do I work to live or live to work?" Why work? Do we work to make money or to have a life? Or, even better, to make a difference? Are you doing what you love? And why not? For the pursuit of money? Or too busy keeping up with the mortgage or 401K so that you may achieve happiness at some later date? Does your job define who you are, or limit who you are?</div>

<div>Financial security is not guaranteed to anyone and real prosperity should be living easily and happily, whether you have dough or not. Beyond being able to provide for your own needs, anything else should be given away freely -- it will come back to you ten fold. Give back. Share or donate your things, your time, your energies. If you want wealth in your life, help others achieve it in theirs. I know this level of self-knowledge takes work to achieve. Most of us are too busy or too distracted to do the work.</div>

<div>Me? My own attempts to have more life in my life are simple. I keep a small, comfortable home. I have always had a live/work studio with low overhead that gives me flexibility to work on projects that I choose and allows access to my family and time off when I need it. My daily schedule allows time for the things I know that I need in my life like study and reflection and exercise. I try to work on projects I find meaningful and make things people won't throw away. The money is rarely enough, but whose is?<br /><br />There is a lovely idea attributed to Aboriginal society that says, "The more you know, the less you need." Accepting less means less clutter and meaningless stuff in our lives. Less distractions, less debt, less greed and craving, less servitude to work.<br /><br />Never settle. Never give in. But accept less.</div>

Generation Flux: Pioneers of the New (&amp; Chaotic) Frontier of Business</a></strong><br />Are you ready to disrupt&hellip; yourself? In a meaty new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/162/generation-flux-future-of-business">cover story</a>, <em>Fast Company </em>editor Bob Safian profiles "Generation Flux," a new breed of unsentimental, risk-taking, self-reinventing creative professionals who are comfortable living - and thriving - in chaos:<br /><br /></div>
<div><span class="pullquote">Despite recession, currency crises, and tremors of financial instability, the pace of disruption is roaring ahead. The frictionless spread of information and the expansion of personal, corporate, and global networks have plenty of room to run. And here's the conundrum: When businesspeople search for the right forecast--the road map and model that will define the next era--no credible long-term picture emerges. There is one certainty, however. The next decade or two will be defined more by fluidity than by any new, settled paradigm; if there is a pattern to all this, it is that there is no pattern. The most valuable insight is that we are, in a critical sense, in a time of chaos.<br /><br />To thrive in this climate requires a whole new approach, which we'll outline in the pages that follow. Because some people will thrive. They are the members of Generation Flux. This is less a demographic designation than a psychographic one: What defines GenFlux is a mind-set that embraces instability, that tolerates--and even enjoys--recalibrating careers, business models, and assumptions. Not everyone will join Generation Flux, but to be successful, businesses and individuals will have to work at it. This is no simple task. The vast bulk of our institutions--educational, corporate, political--are not built for flux. Few traditional career tactics train us for an era where the most important skill is the ability to acquire new skills.</span></div>

Groupthink: Why Brainstorming Doesn't Really Work</strong></a><br /><em>Proust Was A Neuroscientist</em> author and 99% fave Jonah Lehrer debunks the efficacy of brainstorming in an excellent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer"><em>New Yorker</em> article</a>. (It's subscription only, but you can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/design-architecture/why-brainstorming-doesnt-work-8211and-what-does/3748">check out key takeaways here</a>.) According to Lehrer, while creativity continues to become an increasingly collaborative process, reams of research show that ideation is more effective when practiced alone:</div>
<div><br /><span class="pullquote">The underlying assumption of brainstorming is that if people are scared of saying the wrong thing, they'll end up saying nothing at all. The appeal of this idea is obvious: it's always nice to be saturated with positive feedback. Typically participants leave a brainstorming session proud of their contribution. The whiteboard has been filled with free associations. Brainstorming seems like an ideal technique, a feel-good way to boost productivity. But there is a problem with brainstorming. It doesn't work.<br /><br />The first empirical test of [BBDO's Alex] Osborn's brainstorming technique was performed at Yale University, in 1958. Forty-eight male undergraduates were divided into twelve groups and given a series of creative puzzles. The groups were instructed to follow Osborn's guidelines. As a control sample, the scientists gave the same puzzles to forty-eight students working by themselves. The results were a sobering refutation of Osborn. The solo students came up with roughly twice as many solutions as the brainstorming groups, and a panel of judges deemed their solutions more "feasible" and "effective." Brainstorming didn't unleash the potential of the group, but rather made each individual less creative. Although the findings did nothing to hurt brainstorming's popularity, numerous follow-up studies have come to the same conclusion. Keith Sawyer, a psychologist at Washington University, has summarized the science: "Decades of research have consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas."</span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/12/02/steve-jobs-1995-life-failure/"><strong>3. The Secret of Life from Steve Jobs: Poke It</strong></a><br />The RSS ether-waves have been flooded with excerpts, sound bytes, and video clips of the wisdom of Steve Jobs since his passing last October. Of them all, the post that struck me the most was this 1995 interview dug up by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/12/02/steve-jobs-1995-life-failure/">Brainpicking's Maria Popova</a>, in which Jobs describes one simple revelation that changed everything for him:<br /><br /><span class="pullquote">When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.<br />&hellip;<br />The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That's maybe the most important thing. It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.</span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.startupofyou.com/2012/01/the-jammed-career-escalator-old-premises-new-realites/"><strong>4. The Startup of You: Old Premises, New Realities</strong></a><br />Entrepreneur and blogger Ben Casnocha co-authored a new book,<a target="_blank" href="http://www.startupofyou.com/blog/"><em> The Start-Up of You</em></a>, with Reid Hoffman that offers clear-eyed, career-building advice to the next generation of start-up entrepreneurs -- and really anyone entering the professional world in the 21st century. Here are a few of the principles from a recent post on new career realities:<br /><br /><span class="pullquote"><strong>Old: Ready, Aim, Fire&hellip;Retire </strong><br /><strong>New: Almost-Ready, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire.</strong><br />Classic career strategy is&nbsp;Ready, Aim, Fire.&nbsp;Ready&nbsp;is mental, introspective (e.g. pondering "what am I passionate about?").&nbsp;Aim&nbsp;refers to crafting a long-term career plan.&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;means executing on the plan. Ready-aim-fire (and then retire) no longer works. You can't plan your life or career like you used to. These days, the better approach is&nbsp;almost ready-aim-fire-aim-fire-aim-fire.&nbsp;Entrepreneurial career strategy involves learning while going, executing while planning, finishing while starting, aiming while firing. There are no clear start and finish points; no designated "ready" or "set" phase followed by a "go" phase. Still, despite the need for constant recalibration, you can be disciplined about how where you choose to direct your energies and how you choose to adapt to unpredictable changes.<br /><br /><strong>Old: Network Your Way to the Top </strong><br /><strong>New: Build a Network of Allies and Looser Connections</strong><br />Because loyalty is no longer flowing vertically from you to your employer and vice versa, direct your loyalty horizontally, as Dan Pink&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Agent-Nation-Working-Yourself/dp/0446678791/complainandresol">suggests</a>, to your professional network&ndash;to friends, current and former colleagues, and allies who may work in different companies or industries.&nbsp;Those are the people with whom you want to maintain authentic lifelong connections even as you move from company to company. We're all now cynical about "networking." Yet, despite our cynicism about networking in a self-serving, "what can you do for my career" sense, online social networks are huge. And one's professional network still matters more than almost anything else. Building a valuable network of allies and weak ties is a different project than classic networking.<br /><br /><strong>Old: Risk is Bad,&nbsp;Minimize&nbsp;Risk </strong><br /><strong>New: Risk is Unavoidable; Proactively Take Intelligent Risk</strong><br />Risk wasn't a relevant concept in the days of the career escalator. The idea was to avoid risk, and avoid "high risk" career moves like freelancing. This is exactly opposite of how winners think today.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;opportunity contains downside risk. To effectively exploit opportunities, you have to be take on the right kind of risk, and manage it prudently. In so doing, you build resilience to the&nbsp;seismic&nbsp;industry and competitive changes that destroy professionals on a more&nbsp;brittle&nbsp;"low risk" path. There is an entrepreneurial approach to intelligent risk taking, and you may be surprised at how different it is from the stereotyped bet-the-farm, throw caution to the wind approach that people tend to think of when they think of entrepreneurs.</span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2012/01/making_holes_in.php"><strong>5. Why Technology Makes Holes in Our Hearts</strong></a><br />Via the ever-insightful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2012/01/making_holes_in.php">Kevin Kelly</a>, I stumbled on this <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5875243">thought-provoking rant </a>from a disillusioned Gizmodo reporter delivered from the floor of this year's CES technology buffet:<br /><br /><span class="pullquote">There is a hole in my heart dug deep by advertising and envy and a desire to see a thing that is new and different and beautiful. A place within me that is empty, and that I want to fill it up. The hole makes me think electronics can help. And of course, they can. <br /><br />They make the world easier and more enjoyable. They boost productivity and provide entertainment and information and sometimes even status. At least for a while. At least until they are obsolete. At least until they are garbage. <br /><br />Electronics are our talismans that ward off the spiritual vacuum of modernity; gilt in Gorilla Glass and cadmium. And in them we find entertainment in lieu of happiness, and exchanges in lieu of actual connections.</span></div>

Sorting through hundreds of newsprint columns hours before the sun is up, Pat presents a mix of his picks - from politics to pop-culture to health to international news - five days a week.</div>
<div>As appealing as it sounds to have a job that Pat himself describes as "wrapped into a complete package" each day, he's under a constant siege of information. The news never ends, and neither does his team's responsibility to be the viewer's filter - processing the tidal wave of information being published, and selecting what New Yorkers need to know.<br /><br />I met with Pat for "lunch" (at 10:30 am) one morning to discuss how he makes his selections, his constant race against the clock, and why we all must learn how to find the moment when something is "done."<br /><br /><strong>As NY1's morning anchor, you have an unusual schedule. What's a typical day?</strong><br />At 3 am, I wake up. Immediately thereafter I'm on email and on the web, seeing what's going on and what I missed. By 3:30 am, half of our crew is already at NY1, so they'll send me some notes briefing me on what's been happening overnight. By 4 am, I'm in the office, and at 4:30, I'm in the chair pre-recording some segments so we can go live at 5. <br /><br />Starting at about 6:30 am, I actually have some time to focus on what's in the newspapers, and getting ready for 7:40, when we do our first "In the Papers" segment. So the bulk of my 6:30-7:30 hour is digging into what's actually in all the papers, and choosing what I liked, what's on my second tier if I have time, and what's not going to make the cut. For the rest of the morning, we continue at a fairly brisk pace until 8:30 or 9, when it starts to slow down, and we make the transition to our daytime crew. <br /><br /><strong>So you're in the anchor chair from 4:30am-10am. After that, do you head home and sleep?</strong><br />Generally I go home. I've always got a few things going on with other TV programs I'm in discussion on. I've hosted some things in the past for VH1 (The World Series of Trivia), and right now I'm tossing around a pop culture book idea, so I have some meetings on that. But generally at 10 am, my next destination is home, working toward my nap, which I try to make from 1-3 pm. If I get my 2 hours in the afternoon, I'm usually good to stay up until 11.<br /><br /><strong>Do you have any tips about how to be disciplined about a schedule as difficult as yours?</strong><br />Yes, I'm super protective of my nap, and my schedule generally. You have to learn how to say no. I usually keep a pretty hard line about that. You have to be rested and healthy for your job in the morning, so you have to cut some things off, and resist the temptation to go to everything you're invited to.<br /><br /><span class="blockquote">You have to learn how to say no, and resist the temptation to go to everything you're invited to.</span><br /><br /><strong>In your "In the Papers" segment, you curate articles and present the 'best of' the morning papers on air. Can you talk about your curation process?</strong><br />The process is pretty simple - it's a combination of what the major NY papers &nbsp;have chosen to highlight by putting it on the front page or in prominent real estate on the paper, with a combination of what I saw in the paper that interests or surprised me. I try to be the viewer's filter on that. The paper is a diverse document that covers all aspects of life, gossip to serious news, and I want the segment to have some sense of that same balance.<br /><br /><strong>"In The Papers" is one of the first examples of news curation. How did the idea come about?</strong><br />It was one of the ideas of the original founders of NY1, 20 years ago. I think they thought - New York is such a good newspaper town. Certainly it was true back then, and even now I think it's true. That's something that they wanted to tap into. People thought it was absurd at first - it looked like we had run out of news! How desperate is that? We're tipping off people that we got the story from our competitor. Yet, it's the most talked about segment that we do in the morning. It's a service to the newspaper, but it's also a standalone news cast in itself. <br /><br />One of the reasons I've been successful and sort of made "In The Papers" a calling card, is that I believe that I have a good sense of what people will find interesting. Ultimately, that's what they're turning to me for. They're busy, they can't or don't want to read all the papers, but they want to know what's in them, and they're trusting me to do the curation. People have told me that I was logging and content curating before either of those terms were popular.<br /><br /><strong>The majority of your picks are chosen before 7:30 am, but then you continue to post more stories online at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.patspapers.com/">Pat's Papers</a> after you finish at NY1. Do you ever feel "done"?</strong><br />I think anyone in the web world can relate and understand that this is the type of activity that - you could always be doing it. So I try to draw the line somewhere so it doesn't take up 18 hours of my day. &nbsp;You just have to stop. The catch is - you don't want to overwhelm people, or it takes away the curation aspect of it. But at the same time, if you find a story that you think is better than the 10 things you already put up, then you do want to put it up. I don't know where the line is. In any creative line of work that's also a business, you have to come up with the moment at which something is done or good enough. <br /><br /><strong>You've been on the air through September 11th, two wars, and the financial crisis. Has it been hard to stay motivated to deliver such news?<br /></strong><strong></strong>The longer term, depressing stories, like the financial crisis, are actually not particularly difficult, because your pace of the workday is the same. A tougher thing is when you're in a tragic breaking news story. Obviously, September 11th is in a class of its own in that regard. In a situation like that, you're feeling intense pressure in the moment, but you haven't really got time to dwell on it or analyze your own situation or feelings because you're so focused on delivering the information and keeping track of the story and making sure it's accurate and knowing what questions to ask next.<br /><br /><span class="blockquote">In any creative line of work that's also a business, you have to come up with the moment at which something is done or good enough.</span><br /><br />I did a lot of September 11th retrospective interviews this year for the 10th anniversary, and all the panelists were asked the question, "When did it hit you personally?" For me it was after hours and hours on the air. I had to walk home, and I was sitting in my apartment, the sun was setting, and I could see the smoke over the city and that there was this haze over everything. I think it was at that moment, when it came into my personal space at home, that I got a more serious reminder about what had happened, and how this wasn't a story that had happened to somebody else, it happened to all of us. Aside from a time like that, I'm mostly successful in keeping my home life separate from the space of the office.<br /><br /><strong>Do you have any advice for people on how to land their dream job?</strong><br />I think you have to understand what your brand is, what you can bring to the brand, and regardless of how competitive the day-to-day may be, just always put in your best effort. In my case, my job is as much a performance as it is an exercise in journalism. I need to have an appropriate level of enthusiasm and energy at 6AM in the morning, and to step up everyday and know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />One of the things I love about my job is that at the end of the day it has wrapped itself up into a complete package. In my pre-journalism days, the handful of other jobs I had - like working as an accountant during a summer job, and working on the floor of a hardware store - there was always a sense that you did as much as you had time for, and whatever you didn't do, you'd do the next day. It was always very hard for me to be motivated. And at this job, if I'm looking at the clock, it's not because the clock is standing still, it's because I don't have enough time to do all the things I want to do.<br /><br /><strong>Any tips on how to deliver a good story?</strong><br />In any story, I try to always find a stand-alone nugget to grab onto that ideally leaves you with something quotable. I keep that in the back of my head: "Don't just recite the first paragraph of the story, actually give them something they can grab onto and make their own." I try.<br /><br /></div>

Clearly, there's a powerful contradiction here in need of reconciliation.</span>Whether you're starting a new business, debuting a performance, or working with a client, you'll find yourself in the hot seat faced with feedback - and you'll have a decision to make. Do you embrace the criticism and change what you're doing? Or do you gain confidence from being doubted and take solace that all innovation is, at first, misunderstood?<br /><br />Knowing which feedback to embrace and which to discard is perhaps the most important instinct for a creative leader to possess. Nearly every legendary innovation was initially <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/mocked-and-misunderstood.html">mocked or misunderstood</a> by the so-called "experts." In truth, scrutiny and doubt are just part of the toll we pay to take the path less traveled. But knowing this doesn't make it any easier. <br /><br />The question is: When should you embrace your critics and their dogma, and when should you ignore them and carry on? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Savor Criticism, Shun Cynicism</strong></span><br /><br />There are two kinds of doubt you'll encounter in any new venture - criticism and cynicism.<br /><br />Criticism is doubt informed by curiosity and a deep knowledge of a discipline related to your work. Whether the criticism you receive is constructive or not, it comes from knowledge. Informed insights like "I'm not sure someone would ever pay that much" or "you may not want to outsource that given the high-touch required" may cause you to question your approach. <br /><br />By contrast, cynicism is a form of doubt resulting from ignorance and antiquated ways. Industry experts will often express doubt based on an ingrained muscle memory of past experiences that handicaps their vision for the future. Cynical statements like, "People will never read a book on a computer" or "Why would anyone want to put their rolodex online?" are famous doubts expressed by experts with handicapped vision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Knowing which feedback to embrace and which to discard is perhaps the most important instinct for a creative leader to possess.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Doubts and questions can be valuable, but not when they are akin to xenophobia. When investors - and the general public - shun something simply because it is foreign and new... well, this means you are likely one (or more) steps beyond the status quo, which is a good thing! Transformational projects and businesses are like puzzles, and it's very difficult for the masses to see the whole picture when half the pieces are still missing. In such cases, being mocked or misunderstood suggests you're onto something.<br /><br />As entrepreneurs, we must savor criticism and shun cynicism by developing an instinct for the difference between thoughtful insights and short-sightedness. This instinct is the competitive advantage for innovators of all kinds, and it comes straight from the gut. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sharpening Your Gut</strong></span><br /><br />Is gut instinct the culmination of years of experience? Is it strengthened by confidence? How do you sharpen your gut instinct? Here are a few thoughts:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculate the credibility of everything you hear.</strong> If you're talking to a very experienced leader in another field, assess whether she is qualified to have an opinion about your project. Perhaps her perspective should only carry the weight of a potential customer? (If so, keep in mind that customers can't possibly know what they want at the bleeding edge of what's next.) But, if she has deep experience in a similar vertical, her insights should be given more credence. Before absorbing feedback, determine how credible and applicable it is first.</li>
<li><strong>Separate fear and emotion from logic. </strong>Can you consider feedback without the taint of ego or the human fears that we all carry around - namely, failure and embarrassment? I'm not suggesting that you ignore your fears and emotions. On the contrary, you should work to identify the root of them. If you find feedback frustrating, ask yourself why. Often, it means that you are holding onto past assumptions for the wrong reasons or &ldquo;sunk costs&rdquo; (past energy and resources you invested that you'll never get back). I've met many entrepreneurs who recognize a fundamental flaw but miss the chance to fix it because they can't bear to face it.</li>
<li><strong>Recognize patterns, but don't resort to them.</strong> No doubt, a big part of gut instinct also comes from pattern recognition. Seeing the same thing happen, time and time again, gives you an instinct for what might happen next. At the same time, years of experience can also plague you with the same muscle memory that breeds cynicism in the first place. The trick is to keep reiterating your thesis for the future as you process information and compare with past experiences. You should review every decision through two distinct lenses: your past lessons learned (often the hard way), and your conviction for what's next. Sometimes you'll recognize a pattern and realize that it is meant to be broken.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to stomach momentary scrutiny. </strong>Your gut instinct won't add any value if you can't handle scrutiny. A barrage of feedback is, at best, a bounty of useful insight and, at worst, noise. Whatever you do, don't avoid the critics. Feedback is a win-win scenario, so long as you develop your gut instinct and let it do its' thing.</li>
</ul>

While judging contests, looking  for new talent, and conducting design research for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.behance.net">Behance  Network</a>, he has reviewed thousands of creative portfolios on the web.<br /></span>To get some insight on what works (and what doesn't!) when it comes to showcasing creative work online, I chatted with Matias about his observations and extracted six simple tips for building a knockout creative portfolio:<strong><br /><br />1. Take a step back, and curate your best work.</strong> Take the time to look at all of your work and carefully choose the right pieces for your portfolio. "One piece of advice I got from my mentor was to always showcase the type of work you want to be doing in the future," says Matias. "Display only the projects that you are really proud of, that look the best, and that use the best materials."<br /><br />Choose at least five projects so you can demonstrate the breadth of your work, but be selective. Remember, it's always better to have a portfolio of a few projects that are stunning than dozens of projects where some of them are just OK. The quality of your portfolio is only as good as your weakest project.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div class="blockquote">Always showcase the type of work you want to be doing in the future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2. Use eye-catching images, and share the backstory.</strong> Now that you've edited the work you want to show, get into the nitty-gritty of each project and think about how to best present it. Visitors like to know the story behind your finished work, so think about presenting your process -- from the initial concept, to early sketches, to the finished product.<br /><br />A good rule of thumb is to present the whole piece first, followed by more detailed shots to show the precision of your craft. Stylized photography is a nice touch, as long as it doesn't distract from the work itself.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Matias: "First, contextualize the project with a short paragraph. Add a title that makes sense and gives a hint of what this project is about. You want this to be quick reading -- you need to be able to glance at it and understand what it's about.

<div>Once you've decided how to frame and explain your project, focus on finding the perfect images or media to showcase the project, starting with a cover image.<br /><br />"If you're using covers to present your projects in a gallery, it's important that your cover is crafted," says Matias. "Your cover doesn't have to be an exact image from inside your project -- you can custom design a cover if the project requires it. For example, maybe you just want to display text. Unify the look of your covers as much as possible."</div>

Keep the website design simple, and let the work take centerstage. </strong>When designing a portfolio, you want a website that is straightforward. You want your content to be the focal point, rather than a distracting design.<br /><br />"Your website is a vehicle for people to find your work," says Matias. "You don't want the site to be overly flashy or unconventional -- that will make the content more difficult to access. It's not that I prefer minimalistic designs -- it's a question of creating the visual environment you need to showcase your work most effectively. Simplicity in the interface and visual design of your website will push your work to the surface, where it should be."<br /><br />This means simple navigation and the fewest amount of website sections necessary. "Have a gallery of work and a contact page? That's a great portfolio website."</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When it comes to customization, Matias advises you to keep it simple &mdash;pick one font, and keep things consistent. "One font and sticking to it will make your life easier. Pick a color for each link state that's the same across the site."</div>

Craft a bio that expresses your unique process and/or point of view. </strong>Personalize your "about" page to tell your story, not just list your past jobs. Here are a few key pointers for <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7025/The-Resume-Is-Dead-The-Bio-Is-King">reinventing your resume as a compelling bio</a>:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share a Point of View.</strong> As a creative, you have your own unique perspective on your industry and the creative world. Frame your bio with your own creative focus or mission statement.</li>
<li><strong>Create an origin story. </strong>Share the backstory of how you developed your point of view. Did you have an experience as a kid or early in your career that lead you to pursue a passion or shaped your creative direction?</li>
<li><strong>Ground your experience using external details.</strong> Anchor your bio with details that demonstrate your connections through the creative world. Think notable clients, press, or publications.</li>
<li><strong>Be approachable.</strong> Round your story out with some personal trivia. Have any hobbies or interests you obsess about? Revealing some guilty pleasures keeps your bio approachable and relatable.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Personalize your "about" page to tell your story, not just list your past jobs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5. Add distinctive elements (e.g. awards, your blog), and broadcast your work.</strong> Now that you've got all of the necessities, consider any other distinctive elements that you can include to give you an edge.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mention awards. </strong>If you have mentions in press or awards, do include them.</li>
<li><strong>Invite contact.</strong> If you're looking for freelance or contract work, consider using a contact form on your portfolio. Forms from <a target="_blank" href="http://wufoo.com/">Wufoo</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jotform.com/">JotForm</a> allow you to customize fields so you can ask for all the information you need up front, like budget and timeline expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Make sharing easy.</strong> Including buttons to share your work on social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google+) can help bring more exposure and an audience to your site. Promote your work on social media whenever you add new projects to draw attention to fresh work as well as your overall portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Include your blog.</strong> If you do have a blog that you update frequently that also represents where you are professionally or adds value to who you are, include it. Matias advises, "A blog needs to add something to your site - otherwise forget about it. No clutter."</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong><br />6. Keep your portfolio fresh.</strong> Keep in mind that your work doesn't end with just creating a killer portfolio. You'll also want to regularly update it. The best portfolios are never static. As you create new and better work, make sure you make additions to showcase your latest projects, but with the same focus on careful curation!</div>

While it's easy to imagine how to control for output in certain contexts -- say, turning out 100 widgets of equal quality from your factory each day -- it's much more difficult to guarantee that you'll write 10 pages of exactly equal quality for your novel each day.</div>
<div>In other words, all work is not created equal. Willing yourself to suck it up and make that client call or do that distasteful admin task is one kind of work (very controllable), while pushing through a creative block to give something new to the world is another entirely (less controllable).</div>
<div><br />Which is why I want to share a wonderful passage I recently discovered in Lewis Hyde's classic book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-Vintage/dp/0307279502"><em>The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World</em></a>, wherein he makes an elegant distinction between "work" and "creative labor":<br /><br /><span class="pullquote">Work is what we do by the hour. It begins and, if possible, we do it for money. Welding car bodies on an assembly line is work; washing dishes, computing taxes, walking the rounds in a psychiatric ward, picking asparagus--these are work. Labor, on the other hand, sets its own pace. We may get paid for it, but it's harder to quantify... Writing a poem, raising a child, developing a new calculus, resolving a neurosis, invention in all forms -- these are labors.<br /><br />Work is an intended activity that is accomplished through the will. A labor can be intended but only to the extent of doing the groundwork, or of not doing things that would clearly prevent the labor. Beyond that, labor has its own schedule.  <br /><br />[Hyde closes with this striking footnote.]<br /><br />There is no technology, no time-saving device that can alter the rhythms of creative labor. When the worth of labor is expressed in terms of exchange value, therefore, creativity is automatically devalued every time there is an advance in the technology of work.</span><br />As creative professionals, it&rsquo;s easy to confuse "work" and "labor" -- both are a regular part of our everyday. But when we confuse one for the other, we create the illusion that "creative labor" can be willed, managed, or measured, when, in fact, it can only really be, as Hyde points out, beckoned. <br /><br />We can do much to create the time, the space, and the expertise that lead to incredible creative work. But there is no silver bullet; there is no "time-saving device" or productivity system that is going to alter the rhythm of invention.<br /><br />Sometimes we're better off accepting that certain processes can't be rushed.

(We say, "I should have thought of that!") <a target="_blank" href="http://thenounproject.com">The Noun Project</a>, a growing library of free, downloadable icons symbolizing objects and concepts, feels like one of those ideas. So simple it seems obvious, and so useful you can&rsquo;t believe it didn&rsquo;t exist before.</span>Founded by the husband-and-wife team of Edward Boatman and Sofya Polyakov, along with designer <a target="_blank" href="http://simplehonestwork.com/">Scott Thomas</a>, The Noun Project launched in 2010 with a catalog of a few hundred icons and has since grown by leaps and bounds. New symbols are submitted daily by designers around the world, and the Noun Project team recently crowdsourced the translation of its library into 25 languages.<br /><br />We spoke with Edward and Sofya by phone about the childhood fixation that sparked the idea for their visual archive, the struggles of launching a start-up without any experience, and the unexpected rewards of seeing your project take on a life of its own.<br /><br /><strong>It sounds like the Noun Project was born out of a personal obsession of sorts &ndash; can you tell me about that?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward:</strong> I've always done a lot of sketches of all kinds of different concepts, buildings, and objects, and I kind of just got bored of what I was drawing. Then I had the idea to draw the things that used to really fascinate me as a child. If something captivates you as a kid, there's a very intrinsic reason. So I started to draw these really simple, cranes and trains and sequoias and all these silly things, and I found out that I still really enjoy drawing them. <br /><br />So that was how the idea for the Noun Project got started, I thought to myself: "It would be really great if I had a drawing of every single object or concept on the planet." At that time, I was working at an architecture firm, and I had to make a lot of presentation boards for clients, and I always needed really high-quality symbols for trains, bicycles, and trucks. But I couldn't find a website that could provide them.<br /><br />And looking at my silly machine sketches, I thought: "Why not keep that concept but steer it toward solving this real-world problem that I was experiencing at my architecture job?" That's kind of how the idea grew.</div>

<div><strong>What was your background prior to the germination of the Noun Project?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward:</strong> My background is in interior architecture from Iowa State University. My first job out of school was at an architecture firm. I was disillusioned pretty quickly, but I didn't really see a way to change the situation.<br /><br /><strong>What was the source of that disillusionment? The bureaucracy of working on client projects, or...?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward: </strong>Yeah, just the bureaucracy... and coming from design school, if the professor points to something on your project, you know every intimate detail of why you made that decision and what the design thinking was behind executing the idea that way. At my job, there were so many times where someone would just grab me and say, "Hey, can you pick out some colors for this?" and you would know nothing about the project. It didn&rsquo;t really feel like the right way to design. I believe that when you design, you really have to be with the problem for a long time to develop an elegant solution, and it was just very difficult to do that there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">If something captivates you as a kid, there's a very intrinsic reason.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>So when did you really commit yourself to really taking action on the idea behind the Noun Project?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward: </strong>Both Sofya and I had never started a small business or been entrepreneurs before, so there was a big learning curve with getting it off the ground. We started by writing the business plan. We also read some books that helped us move the concept along. One was 37signals' <a target="_blank" href="http://37signals.com/rework/"><em>Rework</em>.</a> I think that helped a lot with simplifying our vision and getting us to really focus on small steps. One of those small steps was gathering up the collection of symbols for the website, and once we started that, we began to experience all the other little problems that we were going to need to solve to get the website launched. Gathering the symbols was really the catalyst that gave us some traction and momentum. And that led us to the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.thenounproject.com/post/6322683836/how-to-launch-a-successful-kickstarter-campaign">Kickstarter campaign</a>.</div>

<div>--</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How long were you gathering those symbols?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward:</strong> About a year. Another huge catalyst was that I got laid off during the recession, so, once that happened, I thought: "Let's try to give this a go!" If I hadn't been laid off, I probably wouldn't have started it.<br /><br /><strong>Does your original business plan have any relation to what you guys are actually doing now?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Sofya: </strong>I think that even though most likely your company will never follow your business plan to a T, it's important to have something written down. There are a lot of things that we were able to think through just by writing the business plan. If I could do it all over again, I do believe we got too caught up in trying to solve every problem that could potentially arise -- and, really, you just never know which way the company is gonna go until you really launch it. <br /><br /><strong>Edward:</strong> I think our first business plan is now sitting under a pile of junk in our credenza. That said, there are key, viable parts in it -- like where we really took the time to write out the mission. That was just incredibly valuable, to really articulate what the mission of the Noun Project was. And that's still our mission today.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">If I hadn't been laid off, I probably wouldn't have started the Noun Project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Can you summarize it quickly?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward: </strong>It's sharing, celebrating and enhancing the world's visual language. It was also helpful to identify the problem, and articulate how we were going to solve it. So, basically, me seeing the problem in the real world that designers didn't have an efficient way to download high-quality symbols for their projects, and then also having a general idea of how we thought we could monetize that and turn it into a business. <br /><br /><strong>So what's kept you guys going so far, what's been the most exciting thing?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Sofya: </strong>For me, probably because I'm not a designer, I'm more interested in the human aspect of it. When we put together our original business plan and launched, we were thinking this could target the creative community, designers, etc. But it's just amazing how many different uses have emerged. We get a lot of emails from teachers who use the symbols in their classroom, or people who work with children with autism, who tend to be visual learners. We just never had any clue about those possibilities before launching.<br /><br /><strong>Edward: </strong>From my perspective, it&rsquo;s just really exhilarating to know the Noun Project has a life of its own. It&rsquo;s also scary, but that's what makes it fun -- not really knowing what the next even three or four months is going to look like. I mean, you can kind of envision what it's going to look like, but you don&rsquo;t really know. For example, Code for America called us up with the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.thenounproject.com/post/7763030153/iconathon-a-new-design-initiative-to-add-civic-symbols">Iconathon idea</a>, and we said, "Let's do it!" Now we&rsquo;re looking at traveling to other countries to do Iconathons. Being that nimble is really exciting. When I was working at an architecture firm, you could probably map out your next 5 years.</div>

<div><strong>Have you encountered any nouns yet that can't be drawn? </strong><br /><br /><strong>Edward:</strong> I think pretty much any concept can be "iconified" if you will. It's just that some are harder than others, and managing that process is pretty fun, and also determining whether its appropriate or not. For example, within the first three weeks of launch, I got a penis symbol. It was a well-drawn but I decided it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate for our audience, because there are a lot of educators and children.<br /><br /><strong>Sofya: </strong>During the Iconathon, we stumbled upon some terms that were incredibly difficult to represent visually, one of them was "college readiness." But that&rsquo;s a large concept, I don't know if you would qualify it as a noun.<br /><br /><strong>Edward:</strong> I can't recall any others, but waking up in the morning and seeing new symbols that I have to either approve or deny is a really fun thing. Recently, we had a South American drink that was submitted, called a "<a target="_blank" href="http://thenounproject.com/noun/mate/#icon-No953">mat&eacute;</a>." I actually made the mistake of denying it because I didn't know what it was. Luckily, the designer emailed me and said, "I showed this to all my friends and everyone instantly recognizes what it is." Then, he sent me a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29">wikipedia link.</a> The reason I didn&rsquo;t understand it was just a cultural difference. It was really interesting to see that come to the surface. Sure, the world is shrinking by the day, but there are still very large cultural differences.</div>

And if you have the luxury of big, open blocks of time, it <em>is</em> a great way to get things done. But what if you don't? What if you get interrupted left and right by clients and co-workers? Is there a way to push creative projects forward in this non-optimal environment?</span>I would argue that it IS possible. And not only is it possible, but &ndash; in certain ways &ndash; as good as or better than waiting for the "perfect" block of time to arrive. Why? Because resisting starting until the ever-elusive perfect moment often leads to extended procrastination. You never have as much time as you'd like to really "settle into" the work so you just keep putting it off &ndash; creating a vicious cycle of over-ambitious goals and little-to-no progress.<br /><br />If this sounds uncomfortably familiar to you, it may be time to own up to the realities of your schedule and consider a different approach.<br /><br />This "Short &amp; Sweet" process developed in collaboration with one of my time coaching clients shows you how to invest the often-overlooked bits of time into your day in meaningful progress on creative projects. <br /><br />Here's how it works:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Write down all possible next steps involved </strong>in completing the project without worrying about whether the list is complete or in order. You don't have to "think of everything" or make the "ideal plan."</li>
<li><strong>Schedule in just 15-30 minutes to move forward on the project. </strong>The point is to set aside a short enough block of time that you can commit to it without feelings of anxiety or hesitation about your ability to follow through. (Think baby steps.)</li>
<li><strong>During that designated time, take action toward your goal </strong>by choosing to make progress on one or more of the steps you brainstormed. Don't aim too high. Just tackle a small amount of work that you know you can actually complete in that time window.</li>
<li><strong>At the end of the time, write down any new steps you discovered</strong> on your master list and schedule the next specific day and time when you will move forward on the project.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat as needed</strong>, which may mean for the entire project or may just mean for the very initial messy stages when making a comprehensive plan or setting aside huge amounts of time to move forward is impossible or fills you with dread.</li>
</ul>
<br />Now, some of you may be wondering: "Will I really get results when I work in these tiny chunks of time? Is it possible to really 'get in the zone'?"<br /><br />The short answer is: Any action is almost always better than none. But there are a number of reasons why working in small chunks might not only be practical, but also preferable for you:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduces build-up energy. </strong>If you haven't made progress on a project for weeks, months or even years, even five minutes of forward movement is an improvement. You can choose to spend longer periods of time on a project, but the Short &amp; Sweet method makes it excruciatingly easy both emotionally and mentally to break through the inertia.</li>
<li><strong>Makes you like yourself &amp; your project again. </strong>When you won't work on a project until the "ideal" moment, you begin to feel a massive weight of guilt and shame that makes you not even want to think about the project that once brought you great joy. Taking small steps forward will help you to feel successful and renew your positive associations with the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>Gives you time to get help. </strong>One of the scary parts of beginning a creative endeavor, especially with a new technology or a new client, is that you aren't quite sure of the total scope of the work. By starting early and starting often, you have time to ask for help, get feedback, make edits or even request a timeline extension before it's too late for you to do so without embarrassment.</li>
<li><strong>Allows you to unleash your brilliance. </strong>As Fred Wilson so beautifully describes in his post on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/06/subconscious-information-processing.html">subconscious information processing</a>, as soon as you give your mind a problem to solve, it starts working day and night on the project. By using short bits of time to move forward, particularly in the initial brainstorming phase, you give yourself a greater opportunity to unleash your genius than you could have done in a long single spurt.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>--</div>
<div><strong>Over to You&hellip;</strong></div>
<div><br />Do you tend to do nothing unless you can get everything done at once? How have you learned to use short bits of time effectively?</div>

Merit is based on your skills, creative output, and ability to work with the team. Leadership is about having confidence and speaking up. </span>In the book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0875847706"><em>The Art of Possibility</em></a>, the conductor Benjamin Zander describes this version of leadership as "leading from any chair"; any individual player can inspire and influence the overall sound of the orchestra.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And "leading from any chair" does work &ndash; the system has produced many of the most innovative products and services that we use these days.<br /><br />But the trend toward flat organizations also has consequences &ndash; and I believe one of them is an emerging leadership gap. As the notion of "coming up through the ranks" dies off, the traditional trajectory to leadership has been short-circuited &ndash; without being properly replaced. <br /><br />"Leading from any chair" produces personal responsibility and teamwork, which is great, but true leadership takes practice, stewardship, and a thorough understanding of how the range of your actions affect the people around you. (Just ask New York Jets head coach, Rex Ryan, whose erratic leadership style has been blamed for fraying the team and ending their season.)<br /><br />Leadership is learned in two primary ways, by example and by trial-and-error. In flat organizations, when project heads are always shifting, there is no distinct model and fewer chances to practice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">As the notion of 'coming up through the ranks' dies off, the traditional trajectory to leadership has been short-circuited &ndash; without being properly replaced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So what to do? How do we develop great future leaders while maintaining the benefits of the flat organization? How do we instill the development of leaders as we continue to shift from a hierarchical structure to a dynamic, networked structure? How do we keep the flexibility and freshness of rotating project teams (or "pop-up teams," as I call them) while also finding the "still point," the consistency and stability at the core of our work? <br /><br />There's certainly no silver bullet; innovation can spring from any type of organizational structure, whether overtly hierarchical or flat. But there's little doubt that strong leadership is central to bringing creative ideas to life. So how can we cultivate that?<br /><br /><strong>1. Hire for personality, drive, execution, and accountability.</strong> Skills and experience will always be essential, but today they're not enough. The value of positive, responsible, and accountable team members who <em>take action</em> cannot be overestimated.<br /><br /><strong>2. Reward leadership. </strong>Clearly define what leadership means within your organization, then reward it aggressively. Often, leadership means putting yourself second and supporting the growth of the organization and others. It also means shepherding them into growth situations. Put them, with support, in uncomfortable situations such as leading client meetings, or giving presentations.<br /><br /><strong>3. Institutionalize mentorship. </strong>To fill the leadership gap, create a methodical in-house mentorship program with clear goals and a purposeful mandate. Mentorship programs can help new employees adjust or be used as a recruitment tool. IBM, for example, started its program to encourage learning and connect people in a large, scattered organization.<br /><br /><strong>4. Establish communication hubs. </strong>The faulty flow of information, especially in organizations that assemble and disassemble themselves on a per-project basis, is the goo that mucks up the works. Hubs can be digital, or they can be actual people. Appointing a communication czar or even just a referee, can save a project. <br /><br /><strong>5. Build a company of <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7012/What-Good-Is-Listening-Anyway">listeners</a> and <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7054/How-To-Break-Through-Bureaucracy-To-Keep-Projects-Moving">question-askers</a>. </strong>A culture that rewards self-awareness and emotional intelligence is a culture of leadership.</div>

How about trying something a little different this year: Take note of your 2011 mistakes and take action to avoid repeating them in 2012&hellip; and maybe even consider making a mistake or two on purpose.</div>
<div>Reflecting on your mistakes doesn't mean beating yourself up or wallowing in your imperfections. It means, at a slight distance, sizing up what didn't go according to plan, figuring out why, and determining what you want to do differently. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, but not everyone makes them worthwhile by using them to get better.</div>
<div><br />Here's how you do it. Free up an hour or two. Find a quiet place &ndash; I found that walking on the beach, if possible, is a great environment for doing this exercise.&nbsp; Reflect back on the things this year that didn't go the way you'd planned. (If you have <a target="_blank" href="http://caddellinsightgroup.com/blog2/2011/12/5-minute-journaling-really-helps-at-year-end-review-time/">journaled your year</a>, print out the entries that reflect mistakes or surprises).</div>
<div><br />See if there are patterns to the mistakes. They will often fall into one of these categories:</div>
<div><br /><ol>
<li><strong>Sloppiness or carelessness.</strong> None of us likes to think of ourselves as sloppy or careless. Yet we are over-committed, over-scheduled, and managing over-flowing email boxes. This can result in unintentional sloppiness: forgetting a meeting, overlooking an action item, not returning a phone call, etc. It's easy to forgive ourselves for these types of mistakes &ndash; we are so busy, after all. But they look bad to others and demonstrate a lack of commitment to the task at hand.&nbsp; At worst, sloppy/careless errors can lead to big problems or even <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8980879/China-bullet-train-crash-caused-by-design-flaws-and-sloppy-safety.html">disasters</a>.  <br /><br />If there's a pattern of sloppiness in your work, you'll have to dial back the "overs." Trying harder won't do it &ndash; that will likely make the problem worse. Find a way to reduce your commitment load. Go to fewer meetings. Filter your email. Push back on your boss when she overcommits you. (It can work &ndash; my wife is the best I've ever seen at managing her boss this way.) For those commitments you do take on, take them seriously. Use a system like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd">Getting Things Done</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.actionmethod.com">Action Method</a> to make sure you don't forget anything. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Playing to your weaknesses.&nbsp;</strong>We are always told to "<a target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/product/how-to-play-to-your-strengths/an/R0501G-PDF-ENG">play to our strengths</a>," but the opposite happens, too. There are parts of our jobs that we haven't mastered yet or just aren't well-suited for. I was once responsible for sales planning at my company, and found that I was <a target="_blank" href="http://mistakebank.caddellinsightgroup.com/2011/12/medical-device-company-ceo-too-often-we.html">hopelessly over-optimistic</a> in my forecasting, resulting in a series of plans we didn't meet.  <br /><br />In a case like this, there are three options. Management textbooks (and the 4-hour work week guy) would tell us to delegate tasks we're not good at. Fine advice, but not everyone has a subordinate they can readily delegate to, or the cash to outsource lots of tasks. <br /><br />You can also work to improve the weakness. Training, self-development, and working with a mentor can all help here. But be cautious in trying to improve too many areas at once.  <br /><br />A final approach is to compensate for the weakness through collaboration with a teammate. Find someone who is very strong in your weak area and work together to complete the task. For example, the CEO of Mazor Robotics <a target="_blank" href="http://mistakebank.caddellinsightgroup.com/2011/12/medical-device-company-ceo-too-often-we.html">assigned one of his managers</a> to be a "devil's advocate" to ensure their revenue forecasts had&nbsp; "humble enough assumptions." <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Making errors under pressure.</strong> Many of us don't work well under pressure; we rush, we try to meet stated and unstated expectations &ndash; our company's, our boss's and our own. Examine where the pressure is coming from &ndash; do you have a <a target="_blank" href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/02/five-signs-you-are-a-bad-boss-in-todays-wall-street-journal.html">crappy boss</a>, or are you putting the pressure on yourself? Are there ways to alleviate the pressure &ndash; renegotiating deliverable dates, reducing the scope of the work product, collaborating with a colleague?  <br /><br />Essential to this exercise is understanding where the value is in your work. What is directly customer-affecting versus internally focused? If you know what's most valuable and what isn't, you will be armed for a discussion with your supervisor to spend more time on the top priorities and less time (or no time) on the others.</li>
</ol></div>
<div><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now What?</strong></span></div>
<div><br />Look at each of the patterns you find and decide on one specific action that could help address it. Make the action as simple as possible (hint: "always" or "never" actions are easier to implement and stick to than more nuanced ones). Here's an example:</div>
<div><br /><span class="pullquote">I had a pattern of responding very quickly to colleagues' emails. Those responses were often sharply worded and not well thought-through. Needless to say, my responses caused quite a bit of conflict.&nbsp; To address this, I decided that I would not respond to any email unless at least 30 minutes had passed &ndash; which would give me time to calm down (if agitated) and think about how I wanted to respond. This was more actionable for me than, "Try to be more thoughtful and careful when you respond to email."</span></div>
<div><br />When you've totaled it all up, you'll end up with 5-10 things you could do. Now think about how many of these things you can successfully implement. It's better to make one change that sticks than five changes that don't. Decide (decide!) on which ones you will do, write them down, and pin them to the wall behind your monitor. Set a reminder in your calendar for every two weeks, to review the list and make sure you are progressing.</div>
<div><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Extra Credit</strong></span><br /><ol>
<li><strong>Look for sins of omission.</strong> Where did you <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7103/Making-Big-Decisions-and-Mastering-the-Consequences">stop yourself from doing something</a> and thereby missed out on an opportunity? How will you approach these situations differently in 2012?</li>
<li><strong>What <a target="_blank" href="http://mistakebank.caddellinsightgroup.com/2011/03/benefiting-from-deliberate-mistakes.html">deliberate mistakes</a> do you want to make in 2012? </strong>Closely examine the way you operate every day. In a world as dynamic as ours has become, operating assumptions go out of date quickly. Pick one or two areas and, in a controlled setting, make deliberate mistakes: intentionally do other than your habit, and see what happens. You may find profitable new ways of doing things. </li>

In his 40+ years of filmmaking, giving us classics like <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>, <em>Brazil</em>, <em>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</em>, <em>Twelve Monkeys</em>, and <em>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</em>, few would argue that he has ever failed in this mission. </span>Gilliam recently made a return visit to Morocco, where he filmed <em>Time Bandits</em> 30 years prior, to receive the highest honor bestowed at the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/">Marrakech International Film Festival</a>, a golden star. At the ceremony, his old friend Emir Kusturica described him grandly as the Franz Kafka of cinema.<br /><br />Here, he opens up about where his ideas come from, the travails of finding money to produce films while trying to keep the momentum going, and how we're all becoming disconnected from reality (by being too connected to our phones).<br /><br /><strong>How do you feel about being called Kafka's counterpart? </strong><br />It'll do. It's nice. I remember somebody said when we were doing <em>Brazil</em> that it was like a cross between Franz Kafka and Frank Capra, which I thought was a great quote. That was perfect. The way Emir was describing it, it obviously had a really strong effect on him. And that to me is all it's about. I want to make films that affect people strongly.<br /><br /><strong>When you quit your job in the '60s on a Chevrolet assembly line, you claimed you would never work a job for money again. What is it you work for today? </strong><br />To keep myself from being bored [laughs]. I still just think there's more films I want to make, and that's all that it's about. I like trying to keep making things to try and get people to react and think. There's nothing specific. It's just a general, being a gadfly I suppose. <br /><br />With <em>Python </em>we sort of had enough money to live reasonably comfortably. I've always lived within my means. I've never been in debt in my life. I refuse to because I know the minute I&rsquo;m in debt, I&rsquo;m then at somebody else's behest, and it's the way Hollywood works. Hollywood is very good about getting everybody out there to live richly. So they're all in debt. They've got mortgages, and they have to keep churning out whatever Hollywood wants them to make. And I can't do that.</div>

Because I've been disappointed probably too many times and I don't want to get excited about anything until I know that it's a possibility. Because that's why, that little <em>Wholly Family</em> film,* somebody came to me and said, "Here's the money. Do you want to work? We can do it in January. Boom." That was great. It's nice to have that with films, and some films have just been so many years, either they have momentum or they don't. Momentum is everything. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>*"The Wholly Family" is Gilliam&rsquo;s most recent project, a short film that tells the story of a bickering family torn apart and brought back together again by a group of masked tricksters, or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulcinella">pulcinellas</a>.</em></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What is the key to telling a great story? </strong><br />I wish I knew. I don't know. It's something that for me it's got to have some substance to it. It isn't just a little romp. Romps don't interest me. It's just, what's it about? And for me it's always trying to get something out of my system. All this stuff starts welling up, and I'm angry and I have to say something about it. And that's how it goes. <br /><br />Then you try to frame it in a way that I guess keeps the audience's attention. You got to get their attention in the beginning, even though you don't, because they paid their money. But it's still nice to get their attention. And then there's the end and you get that right. And then there's that bit in the middle that you just gotta fill up for time. That's the story [laughs].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Your Trilogy of Imagination: <em>Time Bandits</em>, <em>Brazil</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</em> are meant to help us escape from our "awkwardly ordered society." What does it mean to you to create these alternate universes?</strong><br />For me they've always been a way of looking at the world we're living in at that particular moment.&nbsp; And so by stepping out of it, you can end up back in it more clearly. And so most of my films are kind of removed from reality as we know it. But they're all about the reality that we&rsquo;re living in. If you go back to <em>Life of Brian</em>, it was a satire of things at that time, even though we dressed up in Biblical costumes and all that. <br /><br />And it, I just think it's, well, it's the only way I actually know how to function, because I like being able to step back and not just recreate. I don't ever want to try to recreate reality. I've always thought when I&rsquo;m making a film, I like reassuring the audience this is artifice. It may be truthful. It might be closer to the truth than anything else, but it is artifice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">You just carry on. You do things. I'm always doing something, I can't stand sitting around.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Would you ever make a satire about the world we're living in today?</strong><br />Well that's the part... I don't know how to get at it. I mean, how do you get at it? I think if there's anything, it's about how people are becoming so disconnected from reality even though we live in a time when everything is connected.&nbsp; And that's the irony of it. And that's why I've got this house in Italy. When I'm there, I just do manual labor. Just physical work, and dealing with trees, birds, bugs, rocks.<br /><br />And then I start talking to younger people and I realize that they don't understand where things come from. They don't understand how the system works. This is terrifying. They just are consumers, and that's it. And that's like the dream if Orwell had written the dream. We don't live in a socialist or capitalist society; it's a consumerist society, and nobody cares, as long as they've got their goodies. And if it's well-designed, it's even better [points to an iPhone on the table]. <br /><br />And yet at the same time we're supposed to be getting cleverer and thinking. What may be happening is, I just think people are becoming neurons, and they're just part of this big thing. Hollywood was always like this. A new idea pops into the system "Boom!," all these neurons start firing, synaptic gaps are being leapt. And then it dies down and the next idea comes. It goes like that. And the world is becoming like that now.</div>

<div><strong>What's the most important lesson you've learned throughout your film career?&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />If I'd actually learned any of the lessons, I wouldn't be making films anymore. I try not to learn. I spend most of my life unlearning. <br /><br /><strong>What advice do you have for young artists today?</strong></div>
<div>Perseverance, patience, pigheadedness, the three Ps. <br /><br /><strong>The scenes in your films, are often reminiscent of great masterpieces. How do you get your ideas to come to life? </strong><br />I used to say I knew where the ideas came from. Because I'd go to bed, and I'd leave my shoes by the bed. And I'd wake up and there'd be these little elves that would come in and put ideas in my shoes, and I'd just use them. <br /><br />I refuse to intellectualize, or try to understand how it happens. It happens, and I just try to ride with it. And the frightening thing is when it doesn't happen, it's actually terrifying because you realize, "I've dried up. It's finally happened: the well is empty." But, then if you get through those periods, then something starts happening again. A lot of what happens, it's like doing a painting without actually doing a sketch in advance. You just start and you got this, you add another thing, boom, boom, boom. <br /><br />Just for one example, <em>The Wholly Family</em>, is the scene in the hospital. There was always going to be a hospital scene and the boy would see himself as a baby. But then, I was in this place that repairs dolls, the hospital of dolls, and there was this little plastic egg with a Pulcinella in it, so OK, now we have eggs and that's how babies come. And it just changed it. It was beautiful. I think it's about having an idea and never letting it become rigid. It's just the beginning, and then you just see what you can pull into it. At the end, there you are. <br /><br /><strong>Do you have a favorite scene throughout the years?</strong><br />I think I'm pretty proud of the <em>Brazil</em> flying sequences. They were pretty spectacular. Actually, the most sublime shot, there is one. It's in <em>Baron Munchausen</em>. There's a scene where they go to the moon, and there's this big storm and then suddenly we cut to what looks like a starscape. And then the little boat comes in, but it's upside-down, it's the wrong way around, and then the stars disappear and become sand. It was all done in one shot, which I knew what I was trying to do. But it wasn't until we actually turned the film and pulled that, and we did the light change, and I actually went "ohhhhhh, that's fantastic." And that was one of those moments that all the planning wasn't as good as the final result. The final result was a quantum leap. Those are nice moments.</div>

Breaking from our usual habits is difficult and often painful &ndash; requiring not just willpower and stamina but also the courage to take risks, to fail, and to pick ourselves up again.</div>
<div>The turn of the year presents a dangerous allure: That of the clean slate. We make big, bold resolutions as if starting from scratch. Didn't accomplish those 2011 resolutions? Well then, it's time to double-down for 2012!</div>
<div><br />Unfortunately, it's not so simple. Most of us have existing commitments (jobs, relationships, etc) and a slew of bad habits (a Twitter-checking obsession, a weakness for mindless Netflix instant movies) that don't go away at the end of the calendar year.</div>
<div><br />Now, before you think this post is going to depress you, my point is not that we should throw up our hands and do away with New Year's resolutions. Rather, it's that we should simplify our goals &ndash; fully recognizing our existing constraints, strengths, and weaknesses &ndash; so that we can actually achieve them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's choose quality over quantity this year. Let's dispense with the resolutions list that's a vague mishmash of broad ambitions and aspirational new habits in favor of a more targeted, more meaningful, more achievable list of goals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you consider a simplified approach to setting your resolutions for the New Year, here are a few guidelines and resources:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1. Reflect on what you have accomplished.</strong> I love <a target="_blank" href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review/">Chris Guillebeau's annual review</a> approach, not least because it begins with an oft-overlooked activity: reflection. He starts by asking two questions: <em>What went well last year? What didn't go well last year?</em> It's a very simple but useful exercise that takes stock of where you've built new skills for success and where there's room for improvement. After a clear-eyed assessment of what you're capable of, you'll be in good stead to set your goals for the year ahead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2. Select 1-3 meaningful goals that will make an impact. </strong>When it comes to resolutions, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theenergyproject.com/blog/six-keys-changing-almost-anything">research and experience show</a> that you're much more likely to be successful if you: (1) lay out a small list of very specific goals, (2) outline a clear plan of action to achieve them, and (3) plan for what will happen in case of setbacks, distractions, and interruptions. So consider this: What matters most to you in the coming year? What are you passionate about <em>and </em>well-equipped to achieve? Choose your battles wisely, and commit to them completely.</div>
<div><br /><strong>3. Remove the inessentials with a "stop doing" list. </strong>Chances are, you probably weren't working at 80% capacity last year. In fact, I bet you felt<em> too</em> busy. So just where does the extra bandwidth to work on these new resolutions come from? That's where bestselling author Jim Collins' "<a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6216/a-new-kind-of-new-years-resolution-saying-no">Stop Doing List</a>" comes in. To gain the time needed to enact these new goals, know that you're going to have to give up something. It may be extra client work after you meet a certain monthly financial goal, or maybe it's just sleeping in an extra hour. Identify what those elements are, and commit to NOT doing them.</div>
<div><br />--</div>
<div><strong>What's Your Take?</strong></div>
<div><br />How do you decide on your resolutions? What have you been meaning to do for awhile that you haven't done?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Fuseproject founder Yves B&eacute;har, the creator of the Jawbone headset and the $100 laptop, shares the seven principles that define his unique approach to the design process. His vision is one of "holistic making" in which the designer is involved from beginning to end -- from defining the business model to designing the product to manufacturing to marketing. By "being there all the way," B&eacute;har believes that designers can create great products and accelerate the adoption of new ideas.</div>
<div><br /><span class="header">About Yves B&eacute;har</span><br />Yves B&eacute;har is the founder of fuseproject, a San Francisco-based design agency contributing to areas that include technology, furniture, sports, lifestyle, and fashion.

When we do what we are meant to do, money comes to us, doors open for us, we feel useful, and the work we do feels like play to us."</div>
<div>Quotes like this sound great, but can a career ever work out that way? <a target="_blank" href="http://designforfun.com/">Ben Barry</a>, a designer at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, will you tell it can. Walking the halls of Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, you'll see his work everywhere, including a signed poster from President Obama. Today, he's helping design the company's new campus, laying out materials for its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/f8">f8 developer conferences</a>, and coming up with ways to visually represent Facebook's famous hacker culture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We sat down with him on the eve of Facebook's move to their new headquarters to ask him what it takes to do great work, having the guts to believe in yourself, and how the importance of personal projects can help you land your dream gig.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How did you get hired at Facebook? </strong></div>
<div>I was happily living and working in Austin, Texas and then one day an ad showed up that Facebook was looking for designers &ndash; targeted at me because in my Facebook profile I had listed "designer" as my occupation. I clicked over, applied, and next thing I knew I was in Silicon Valley interviewing. I had only worked for really small shops up until then so it was a bit different to come on board with such a rapidly growing company but also a lot of fun.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Are you a specialist or a generalist? </strong></div>
<div>I consider myself a generalist. I'm interested in all sorts of stuff. I write code. I screen print. I dabble in letterpress and bookbinding. I sort of want to do it all and also be good at everything. I have some close friends that are incredibly talented specialists and I get sort of envious. They're super-badass at one or two things. They've been able to focus and become experts, but I guess there are too many things I'm interested in learning. I'm thankful that the current technology trends at play in the world have made it possible for me to dabble in these different areas without having to specialize.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What's your take on Facebook's success? </strong></div>
<div>Every generation builds on the technologies and infrastructure of the previous generation. Facebook had all these technologies available at just the right time so a college kid named Mark Zuckerberg could launch this company with his friends from their dorm room. It wouldn't have been possible 5 or 10 years prior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thirty years ago it took a lot of people to create something of value, and we've been investing in the technology so that now just one person can add more value to the world. So, we've been working really hard at further creating technologies like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/platform">Facebook Platform</a> that enables individuals to have greater impact through their work by being able to easily make their products social.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How do you spend your time?</strong></div>
<div>It's different every day depending on what projects I having going on. Most of the energy the past two years has been put into thinking about the role of the Communication Design team. Now, I'm spending a lot more of my time helping to make sure the hacker culture stays intact as we grow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How have you grown in your position? </strong></div>
<div>In addition to web design, I've always had an interest in traditional print design. We had a bunch of leased space, and I was able to get access to one of the warehouse buildings to set up a little workshop in the back by the loading dock. After work and on the weekends, I kind of secretly built out a little <a target="_blank" href="http://www.designforfun.com/display.php?id=108&amp;e=1">screen printing studio</a>. Once I got it setup and working I was able to start making posters that I put all around the company. Now it makes up a big part of my job, even though nobody asked me to do it and it's not what I was originally hired to do. I didn't ask for permission, I just did it.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What do you think is key to moving ahead in a creative field?</strong></div>
<div>Something that is often overlooked with creatives is time management and getting shit done. You can be the most talented designer in the world but if you don't follow through and get stuff out there, it doesn't matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have several friends that are incredibly talented. They will start on projects but rarely follow through. They get bored or distracted or discouraged that it's not "perfect" and give up. Following through and finishing things is one of the most important things you can learn. <br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is "Done is better than perfect." That doesn't mean making crap &ndash; I believe you should always strive for the highest quality you can &ndash; but you have to finish. I think a lot of my friends in this situation don't realize how in-demand their skills are. I think if you follow through on projects and just put the tiniest little effort into promoting yourself and have the tiniest bit of self-confidence, you can get the job you want.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What unspoken skills help make for great work? </strong></div>
<div>The skill I often see overlooked is design thinking. I say this half-joking but half serious: the most important piece of software a designer can know is TextEdit. Sitting down and getting thoughts in writing about what it is you're doing, who it's for, why you're doing it &ndash; once you have that clear understanding, it becomes much easier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I don't do this first, I find myself sitting down thinking "Uhhh&hellip;. What do I do?" When I have thought through and done that work upfront, I sit down knowing the problem and it becomes really easy to solve. It sort of designs itself if you do that design thinking work first.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img title="hackposter1_550" alt="hackposter1_550" src="http://the99percent.com/assets/99/img/uploads/2011/hackposter1_550.png" width="550" height="386" /></div>
<div><em><span style="font-size: small;">A poster Barry designed at a recent Facebook hackathon.</span></em></div>
<div>-<br /><br /></div>
<div><strong>What soft skills do people often underestimate? </strong></div>
<div>Pitching and presenting your work well. It's something I see all the time as students and I probably did as a student myself &ndash; making excuses. But fortunately I had a professor who said, "You never make excuses for poor work." You just never go into a meeting saying, "Well, if I had more time or this isn't very good..." No. Even if you're thinking those things, you sell it and don't ever make excuses. [Laughs] The other thing of course is never show anything you don't want to have produced. I try to live by that.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Any advice for those aspiring to do great work? </strong></div>
<div>Well, one of the first student portfolio reviews I ever did involved sitting down with this student's work, and she had a lot of business-to-business corporate projects in her portfolio. I was flipping through it, and I stopped and just asked her, "Is this what you want to do? Is this the kind of work you want to do for the rest of your career? If it is, then this is perfect."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was nothing technically wrong with her work. The layouts were beautiful, the photography well-selected, but it was completely, in my opinion, boring and uninspiring. There was nothing innovative or disruptive about it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If design is just a 9-to-5 job for you then that's a different set of requirements. I guess everything I'm saying in this interview is not to those people though. To me, it's a calling. You come home and you can't turn it off. I'm speaking to those kinds of people. So my advice is to figure out what kind of designer you aspire to be and then focus on doing that kind of work.</div>

<div>-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How do you breakout and answer that calling then? </strong></div>
<div>I've always done a lot of personal projects. At Facebook, I wanted to set up an entire print studio because that's the kind of work I wanted to be doing. I came in on the nights and weekends and built it. Over time, I got more and more requests to do that type of work, and I'm able to justify that as my job.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have to make those opportunities happen and take those risks. I've always said that if what I'm doing isn't resonating with where I am, it's better for me to go somewhere else where it does. So, if you want to get into a certain type of work, you just have to do it on your own terms so that people will then pay you to do it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Do you ever struggle with self-doubt? </strong></div>
<div>Definitely. One of the benefits of having all these great design books and online resources around me is they really inspire me and other times it's like "Fuck. I'm never going to be that good." It can be really easy to fall into that trap and stop making things, but you just have to realize that everyone who is successful has made plenty of mistakes along the way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have always had&nbsp;this view of the world that everybody has access to the same resources I do and if these people can do it, I can do it, too. I recently came across <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEiSa6_EPA">this video</a> after Steve Jobs passed away. It resonated with me a lot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What advice do you have for people starting out?</strong></div>
<div>I look at a lot of my mentors, and they're very good at building that relationship with the client and pitching and selling their ideas. They're all amazing storytellers, and it became immediately apparent to me my first year out of school that I was terrible at this. <br /><br />When you're in design school, it's so easy to do good work. You want to do good work. Your teachers want you to do good work and that's pretty much it. But it's also completely unrealistic, because you don't have to deal with budgets or clients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you come out of school you have to convince people that you have good ideas so they will give you money to do stuff. A big part of this is knowing your own weaknesses and then identifying and partnering with people that can help you accomplish your goals.</div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Poster designed for Barack Obama's visit to Facebook, and signed by the man himself.</em></span></div>
<div>-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What was it like designing the print materials for President Obama's visit to Facebook last April? </strong></div>
<div>We only had about a week and a half notice before he was coming. The first thing I thought was "Okay, Obama's coming and I gotta design a poster and somehow get him to sign it because when else will you ever have an opportunity to have the President sign something you designed?"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I got sucked into doing a bunch of other stuff for the event on top of traveling and other project work, and it comes down to the night before the visit and I still hadn't designed or printed the posters. So, I go to dinner at our cafeteria and I had a few ideas but I knew they weren't good enough. I flipped open my laptop over dinner and worked on a concept, burned the film, and screen printed 50 posters.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now it's about 10 o'clock and I'm cleaning up and I knew I wasn't going to get close to the President and I figured the only way it would get signed was if Mark [Zuckerberg] would ask him to do it. So, I snapped a photo with my phone and shot an email to him asking if he'd try and get him to sign it. I'm about to leave it on his desk and he writes back saying something like, "Yeah, it looks awesome. I'll try and get him to sign it."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I'm stacking up the posters about to leave for the night, I realize I misspelled Barack Obama's name on the poster. I was pissed. What could I do? I went back and output new film, burned new screens, and printed an edition of 10 correct posters. Mark was able to get him to sign it and now it hangs in our offices, so that's pretty cool. The phrase "pain is temporary, film is forever" comes to mind with a project like this.</div>

<div>At 3pm, he closes his eyes at his desk and takes a rest. Sometimes it turns into a 15- or 20-minute nap. Finally, between 4:30 and 5pm, Nick takes a 15-minute walk outside.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bill spends 10 hours on the job. He begins work at about 80% of his capacity, instinctively pacing himself rather than pushing all out, because he knows he's got a long day ahead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By 1pm, Bill is feeling some fatigue. He's dropped to 60% of his capacity and he's inexorably losing steam.&nbsp; Between 4 and 7pm, he's averaging about 40% of his capacity.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="blockquote">By 1pm, Bill is feeling some fatigue. He's dropped to 60% of his capacity and he's inexorably losing steam.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It's called the law of diminishing returns. Bill's average over 10 hours is 60% of his capacity, which means he effectively delivers 6 hours of work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nick puts in the same 10 hours. He feels comfortable working at 90% of his capacity, because he knows he's going to have a break before too long. He slows a little as the day wears on, but after a midday lunch or workout, and a midafternoon rest, he's still at 70% during the last three hours of the day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nick takes off a total of 2 hours during his 10 at work, so he only puts in 8 hours. During that time, he's working at an average of 80% of his capacity, so he's delivering just under 6 &frac12; hours of work &ndash; a half hour more than Bill.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Because Nick is more focused and alert than Bill, he also makes fewer mistakes, and when he returns home at night, he has more energy left for his family.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It's not just the number of hours we sit at a desk that determines the value we generate. It's the energy we bring to the hours we work.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Human beings are designed to pulse rhythmically between spending and renewing energy. That's how we operate at our best.&nbsp; Maintaining a steady reservoir of energy &ndash; physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually &ndash; requires refueling it intermittently.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">It's not just the number of hours we sit at a desk that determines the value we generate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Work the way Nick does, and you'll get more done, in less time, at a higher level of quality, more sustainably.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Create a workplace that truly values a balanced relationship between intense work and real renewal, and you'll not only get greater productivity from employees, but also higher engagement and job satisfaction.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There's plenty of evidence that increased rest and renewal serve performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Consider the Federal Aviation Administration study of pilots on long haul flights. One group of pilots was given an opportunity to take 40-minute naps mid-flight, and ended up getting an average of 26 minutes of actual sleep. Their median reaction time improved by 16% following their naps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Non-napping pilots, tested at a similar halfway point in the flight, had a 34% deterioration in reaction time. They also experienced 22 micro sleeps of 2-10 seconds during the last 30 minutes of the flight. The pilots who took naps had none.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="blockquote">There's plenty of evidence that increased rest and renewal serve performance.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or consider the study that performance expert Anders Ericcson did of violinists at the Berlin Academy of Music. The best of the violinists practiced in sessions no longer than 90 minutes, and took a break in between each one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The best violinists almost never practiced more than 4 &frac12; hours over a day. What they instinctively understood was the law of diminishing returns.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The top violinists also got an average of more than 8 hours of sleep a night, and took a 20-30 minute nap every afternoon. Over a week, they slept 16 hours more than the average American does.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>During my 30s and 40s, I wrote three books. I sat at my desk each day from 7am to 7pm, struggling to stay focused. Each book took me at least a year to write. For my most recent books, I wrote in a schedule that matched the great violinists &ndash; three 90-minute sessions with a renewal break in between each one.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I wrote both those books in six months &ndash; investing less than half the number of hours I had for each of my first three books.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I was working, I was truly working. When I was recharging &ndash; whether by getting something to eat, or meditating, or taking a run &ndash; I was truly refueling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Stress isn't the enemy in the workplace. Indeed, stress is the only means by which we can expand capacity. Just think about weightlifting.&nbsp; By stressing your muscles, and then recovering, you gradually build strength.&nbsp; Our real enemy at work is the absence of intermittent renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

But it's easier said than done, right?</span>In the split-second when you have to decide whether to plough on with the next stage of a difficult project, or to answer a ringing phone or pinging email, it can be hard to resist the pressure to respond. After all, the other person is waiting <em>now</em> - and your project may not be done for weeks. What difference will one more phone call or email make?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And of course 'just one more' doesn't feel like it makes a big difference. But if it's a habitual practice, that amounts to thousands of emails, phone calls, and errands a year - and whole weeks of creative worktime lost.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But if you keep steadily chipping away, day after day - at the blank page, empty screen, canvas, block of stone, or whatever - you are slowly and steadily filling your time with remarkable work. By the end of the year, you will be looking back on a series of achievements (or at least notable failures, that taught you something valuable). Compare that with a year's worth of inbox zero and placated colleagues, and there's no contest - not for a true creative.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>So how can you ensure you end up with a full portfolio instead of an empty inbox?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Having coached many people on this, and struggled with it myself, I've noticed a subtle but important difference in mindset between those who get swept away by the demands of the moment and those who persevere and create something that endures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Those who get swept off track do so because they are thinking short-term:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pullquote">The phone is ringing <em>now</em>, so I need to answer it.<br /><br />The email has just arrived, I need to get rid of it ASAP.<br /><br />I'll just get this one out of the way, it shouldn't take long...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you think like this, the pressures of the moment will always feel more urgent than settling down to wrestle with something truly important (and difficult).&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>But those who persevere take a longer perspective:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Firstly, long before the moment of decision, they've taken time out to consider where they are headed, and the long-term consequences of their daily working habits.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And secondly, when faced with a choice in the moment, they 'fast forward' in their mind, to a few hours in the future, and <em>imagine how each option will make them feel afterwards</em>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try it for yourself, right now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Picture yourself in a few hours' time, having spent the best part of your day firefighting email and running errands for other people. I'm guessing you'll feel frustrated and disappointed. Because you'll know you missed an opportunity to create something remarkable today. And you won't get another today.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>OK scratch that scenario.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now imagine you have spent several hours working away steadily on your latest and biggest creative challenge. You have faced down the <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7017/Overcome-Resistance-and-Get-Out-of-Your-Own-Way%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Resistance</a>, knuckled down and made some progress, in spite of the difficulty. Deep down, you feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing you did what you set out to do. You still have a long way to go, but you've taken another step in the right direction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sure, you may have to play catch-up on email and phone calls, and smooth over a few ruffled feathers, but most people will forgive you if you give them what they want in the end. And it's a small price to pay for what you've achieved.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So as we approach the end of 2011, here are three things you can do to make sure 2012 is your most creative and productive year yet:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1. Before the start of the year :</strong><br />Look ahead and decide what are the big projects you want to achieve next year. Imagine how you will feel at the year's end once you've achieved them. That's your reward. Write the projects down - including deadlines - and put a reminder in your calendar so that you hold yourself accountable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2. At the start of every week :</strong><br />Look ahead and decide what you want to achieve that week. Work out how many days/hours you'll need to block off for sustained work. Imagine how you'll feel at the week's end once you've done this. That's your reward.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now think ahead to anticipate important deadlines and demands from others that are likely to arise during the week. Schedule time to get the necessary work done on time, to avoid letting people down on critical projects.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3. At start of every day:</strong><br /> Look ahead and decide what you want to achieve today. How many hours do you need to block off for focused work? Imagine how you'll feel at the day's end once you've done it. That's your reward.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At each step, you should also consider an alternative universe, where you let other people's demands dictate to you - hour by hour, day by day, year by year. How does <em>that</em> feel? Again, that's your reward, if you choose this path.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Next time you're faced with the temptation to cave in to the apparently urgent instead of getting on with what's truly important to you - remember the two paths ahead of you. Look ahead, and choose wisely.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>--</div>
<div><strong>What Do You Make Of This?</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What difference does it make to your decision-making when you look ahead and imagine how you'll feel after choosing each option?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any other tips for staying focused on important work in the midst of demands and distractions?</div>

<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tips on Teaching Yourself </strong></span><br /><br />Now that you know where to go to learn your chosen software, you're ready to start teaching yourself - which is no small task! You're going to need a good dose of <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7094/The-Future-of-Self-Improvement-Part-I-Grit-Is-More-Important-Than-Talent">grit</a>, and a plan. Here are a few tips for getting started:<br /><br /><strong>1. Block out time.</strong><br />One of the main reasons classroom settings are so effective is that they force you to show up and commit dedicated time to learning. Block out time in your schedule in advance for learning your software of choice, and then respect it just like you would a class where your grade could get docked for not showing up.<br /><br /><strong>2. Use two monitors.</strong><br />If you can find a cheap one, a second monitor empowers you to make much more effective use of video tutorials, by having the tutorial playing on one screen and having the application itself open on the other.<br /><br /><strong>3. Find a forum.</strong><br />There are going to be times when you just don't understand how to do something in a tutorial. Fortunately, there are great support communities out there for most any type of software. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.photoshopgurus.com/forum/">Photoshop Gurus</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://forum.ableton.com/viewforum.php?f=2">Ableton User Help Exchange</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.creativecow.net/">Creative Cow</a> are a few examples, or you can just google your question and take it from there.<br /><br /><strong>4. Give yourself a project.</strong><br />If there's anything that will help keep you on-track with your learning and provide a meaningful structure, it's setting up a real, tangible project that you will execute with the knowledge you're gaining. (It will also keep you from feeling overwhelmed about learning software features you may not really need.) Whether it's building a small website, making a song, or creating a short film, use your new learning to create something real. That's what'll make it stick.</div>

After cycling through a range of training regimes that had varying impact, I decided that if I really wanted to run well, I should study the best runners and emulate their approach. I didn't become an elite marathoner but I did improve my results dramatically. And, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I could use the very same methods to improve my work as well.</span>Here are a few key things that great long distances runners do to achieve their best that I believe are equally applicable to achieving remarkable things in your work life:<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>1. Adopt concrete goals that aim toward excellence.</strong><br />Elite athletes have very specific goals about what they want to achieve. (Sometimes these goals can be measured right down to the sub-second!) Then they focus all of their efforts - workout training, mental visualization, eating regime, etc - on what it will take to achieve them. They do not train aimlessly.<br />&nbsp;<br />Similarly, you will want to <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6753/Finish-Your-Masterpiece-with-Deliberate-Goal-Planning-">set specific goals</a> for achieving personal excellence in your work. One approach would be to set a 1-, 2-, or 5-year goal to achieve a certain position within the company you work for, or to complete a major creative project that you can share with the world. The more excited you are about these goals, and the clearer they are, the more motivated you will be to do your best.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>2. Design a training regime, engage coaches &amp; expand your expertise.</strong><br />Great athletes train constantly, and they have great coaches to observe and guide them. They <a href="http://the99percent.com/videos/7061/Joshua-Foer-Step-Outside-Your-Comfort-Zone-and-Study-Yourself-Failing">never go on autopilot</a>; rather, they constantly up the ante on their training regime to incorporate new challenges that force them to raise the level of their game. <br /><br />You, too, should constantly strive to expand your skill set - be it with formal classroom training, on-the-job skill development, or even learning about new technologies and gaining expertise outside work. You'll also want to get as much "<a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7095/The-Future-of-Self-Improvement-Part-II-The-Dilemma-of-Coaching-Yourself">coaching</a>" as you can. Find mentors to guide you and give you advice. Talk to senior people around you and solicit their input. Talk to experts at conferences and other events and learn as much as you can, then turn around and incorporate that into the work that you are doing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="blockquote">Elite athletes have very specific goals about what they want to achieve. They do not train aimlessly.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>3. Keep a log of your efforts and the outcomes.</strong><br />Good runners not only plan their goals and train, they also rigorously track their efforts and document the results. This allows them to observe patterns, see what is (and isn't) working, and make adjustments to their training regime and goals along the way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In a professional context, you can track, for example, how you are investing your creative time and what outcomes you have achieved. Perhaps you will notice that a small time investment in one arena (say, online marketing or generating new portfolio pieces) yields very high benefits, while your time spent cold calling clients yields little reward. Just keeping a log of your efforts and the end results allows patterns to emerge that you might not otherwise notice.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>4. Take the long view.</strong><br />While elite marathon runners always bring their full commitment to the race that they are running, they also commit themselves to a long-term series of events and races spread over many years. They want to succeed in the upcoming race, but they also want to use that race to prepare themselves for a bigger race that will be followed by a still bigger race, until they get to the world championships and the chance to set world records. They have a plan that will allow them to succeed and grow, and everything fits into place.<br />&nbsp;<br />While the race of life may not be as predictable as a marathon, taking the long view can still yield huge benefits. Rather than bouncing from job to job or project to project randomly or without aim, try to plan your current work in such a way that each project or job builds upon the previous one, ultimately leading you toward the bigger, better opportunities in the future that come from accrued achievement.<br /><br />--<br /><strong>What's Your Experience?</strong></div>

Many would gladly set aside all practicalities and immerse themselves fully in learning, exploring, and creating if a benefactor would kindly rid them of the need to attend to trivialities like keeping track of time, making money, or doing laundry.</span>This passion for expression generally serves us well when our main work goal is the production of stellar projects. But, when job descriptions change (and responsibilities increase), this abandon to the creative process can quickly lead to mounting frustration for you and your team.<br /><br />For example, when a graphic designer becomes an art director or an employee becomes a business owner or a top performer becomes a trainer, their previous methods of allocating time just won't work anymore. As Marshall Goldsmith explains in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/12/02/review-what-got-you-here-wont-get-you-there/"><em>What Got You Here Won't Get You There</em></a>, your career advancing to the next level also means that your skills need to advance to keep up.<br /><br />To help you understand how different career changes have an impact on your schedule, I've laid out common shifts I've observed in my coaching clients' lives and suggestions on how you can measure and respond to them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Your career advancing to the next level also means that your skills need to advance to keep up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MORE RESPONSIBILITY</strong></span><br /><br />Despite popular opinion, the number of hours in a day doesn't expand in proportion to the growth in your job description. In order to fit in more activity without losing your balance, you need to think differently about your time allocation. <br /><br />To help you assess how you should be approaching activities given your new workload, I've developed a simple routine that I call "INO."</div>
<div><br />First, write out all of the activities related to your job. Then, categorize each of them as an investment, neutral, or optimize activity:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment: </strong>Spending more time on these activities could lead to a significant increase in the benefits you receive. <em>Example: A significant career-enhancing project that helps you grow your skill set.</em></li>
<li><strong>Neutral: </strong>These activities give back as much as you put into them.<em> Example: Billable hourly work, where you aren't building out your portfolio or developing new skills.</em></li>
<li><strong>Optimize: </strong>More time spent on these activities results in decreasing benefits. <em>Example: Routine email or paperwork.</em></li>
</ul>
<br />As you scan your completed list, you will want to:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Complete the "Optimize" activities as quickly as possible. </li>
<li>Limit the amount of time you spend on "Neutral" activities.</li>
<li>Maximize the time you spend moving forward on "Investment" activities. </li>
<li>Re-evaluate as necessary.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MORE MANAGEMENT</strong></span><br /><br />Increases in the number of people who report to you should mean that the overall output of your team increases, IF you're delegating properly. But more management responsibility also means, of course, that you have to "let go" of some tasks.<br /><br />To understand how much of your time different staff members receive from you and what you can delegate to gain back time for your creative projects, try this type of assessment:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make a mind map or list of all of the different people reporting to you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Detail out what each one of these people needs to receive from you such as:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Monthly one-on-one meetings (1 hour/month)</li>
<li>Weekly feedback on their current projects (2 hours/week)</li>
<li>Emotional support when they have a setback (varies)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorm all they could give back to you. </strong>The possibilities are endless. Your list might include things like:   
<ul>
<li>Absorbing regular maintenance tasks, which could be anything from managing social media to writing blog posts to prepping files to answering customer emails, and so on. (4-8 hours/week)</li>
<li>Completing a major research or archival project. (5 days)</li>
<li>Taking over leading a committee or a regular meeting. (3 hours/month)</li>
<li>Attending a professional conference or seminar on your behalf. (1-2 days)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Calculate how much time can be spent on getting your own projects done </strong>by subtracting out what others are receiving from you and adding back the time you are gaining from delegating to them. <em>Example: 40 hours-20 hours+10 hours=30 hours spent on moving forward your projects (20 hours that you do and 10 hours that someone did for you).</em></li>
<li><strong>Assess whether you feel that you have the proper balance of giving and receiving and adapt as necessary. </strong>The goal is to maximize the total potential output of your team and the time you personally spend on top quality "investment" activities without anyone burning out.</li>
</ul>
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MORE TRAVEL</strong></span><br /><br />Jet-setting seems glamorous&mdash;you get to explore new places, engage with new people, and gain premier status. But after a few months of trotting around the country or the globe, travel can lose its luster if you don't practice a few simple strategies to keep your life in order:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Always block in time on your calendar before a trip for prep and packing</strong> and after a trip for wrap up and rest. If you don't take care of submitting receipts and following up on leads immediately, those details can cause huge stress later. </li>
<li><strong>Keep to the essential routines for your health and happiness.</strong> If meditation is a must, wake up early enough to make it happen or download a recording you can listen to in transit. If exercise has to happen, spend your 30-minute break between meetings walking around the hallways and going up and down the stairs. </li>
<li><strong>Split up your to-do lists using David Allen's <em>Getting Things Done</em> location-focused method.</strong> For instance, you could make these kinds of categories: At Home, In Waiting Rooms, On Planes, When Driving.</li>
<li><strong>Decide on certain personal, yet location-independent, activities to do on the road </strong>such as: reading books, calling friends, or researching a new gadget. Planning these type of personal items will give you a reason to stop working in the evenings and make sure that you have time to recharge and refresh.</li>
</ul>
<br />Recognizing and adapting to these expectation-changers gives you greater clarity on what's possible, allows you to feel good about how you're spending your time, and helps you make&mdash;and keep&mdash;the right promises to yourself and others.</div>
<div><br />--</div>
<div><strong>What's Your Perspective?</strong></div>
<div><br />What external job changes have required you to adapt your internal expectations? What new standards did you set for yourself?</div>

You can ask any member of the Behance Team who's seen me before a big product launch or other major event. My attention to detail, normally a strength, can become a compulsive need to verify everything. If I'm not careful, my drive to be helpful can backfire.</span>In tough situations, with fires ablaze, certain strengths have the tendency to become weaknesses.&nbsp;For example, under stress, a natural and healthy tendency toward neatness and organization can turn compulsive. Smart people with great questions can become ruthless interrogators. Those who take pride in their laser-like focus can become too micro and miss the big picture.<br /><br />When handled improperly, stress acts like kryptonite. It causes your superpowers to turn against you; and, if you're not careful, your stress can defeat you. While you can't avoid stress, you can calibrate your reaction to it:<br /><br /><strong>1. Ground your decisions in procedure.</strong><br />Under stress, we often make decisions more quickly and with less information than usual - the perfect setup for disaster. The best way to avoid this trigger response is to have a procedure in place. Ideally, one than forces you to walk through the steps and get the information you need prior to taking action.<br /><br />Many great development and technology teams, including our own team at Behance, maintain an "emergency sheet" that explains what to do if a website or key system goes down. The emergency sheet is prepared in advance and kept updated with simple step-by-step instructions for what to do first, who to notify, and how to proceed when the site goes down. <br /><br />Having a clear procedure for solving certain problems prevents brash decisions and ill-conceived solutions. The trick is to learn from mistakes made under stress and, afterwards, develop a procedure to follow the next time around.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote">Under stress, we often make decisions more quickly and with less information than usual - the perfect setup for disaster.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2. Stay open.</strong><br />For good reason, stress makes you defensive. Unfortunately, defensiveness makes you less open and alert to the resources and information around you. When I get stressed, I instinctively become more self-reliant. (Perhaps it is my fear of failure that makes me put my head down and try to solve things all by myself?)<br /><br />Ironically, at the times when it's most important for us to consult our colleagues and absorb the opinions of others, we're inclined to isolate ourselves. To offset this tendency, I make special efforts to engage people around me in times of stress. I pose more questions than usual. If I'm working under severe time constraints - drafting quick emails and attempting a quick solution - I remind myself to request a "gut check" from someone else on my team before taking action.</div>

<div><strong>3. Don't regress.</strong><br />If you're not careful, stress will conjure up the very worst of your natural impulses - paranoia, selfishness, and short-sightedness, among them. You're also liable to misinterpret peoples' intentions and ignore the help that you need.<br /><br />This is because stress is a natural consequence of the struggle against our primal tendencies. The instinct to run away from danger, or to fend for oneself at the expense of others, is in our ancestral DNA - what Seth Godin calls our "<a href="http://the99percent.com/videos/5822/Seth-Godin-Quieting-the-Lizard-Brain">lizard brain</a>."&nbsp; We need to be aware of these deeply ingrained tendencies and push ourselves to keep evolving.<br /><br /></div>

<div>Great leadership requires a deep sense of self-awareness and a willingness to, when necessary, transform yourself. I say "transform" because your default behaviors, many of which can be destructive, will need to change. <br /><br />For better or worse, the most critical decisions are often made during the most challenging times.&nbsp;By being aware of how stress tweaks your perspective, you can learn how to draw strength from crises rather than being overwhelmed or defeated by them.</div>

Packed with great insights on increasing workplace engagement and satisfaction, <em>The Progress Principle</em> is a perfect "next read" for fans of Dan Pink's <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.danpink.com/drive">Drive</a>.</em><br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321999763&amp;sr=1-1">Where Good Ideas Come From</a>, by Steven Johnson</strong><br />As he tracks "the natural history of innovation," Steven Johnson takes us through tales of great ideas realized (and unrealized), ranging from Miles Davis' jazz evolution to the 9/11 investigation to the invention of Google News. Along the way, he shows how ideas germinate in unexpected ways - slow hunches, errors, serendipity, and exaption, to name a few.<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465010210/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321993894&amp;sr=1-1">Alone Together</a>, by Sherry Turkle</strong><br />With our mobile devices and social media, we're supposed to be more engaged and connected than ever before. But it doesn't always feel that way, does it? Here, MIT technology and society professor Sherry Turkle meditates on a less-talked about topic: The loneliness, anxiety, and disassociation engendered by communicating via objects rather than face-to-face interactions. A thoughtful read.<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Incognito-Secret-Lives-David-Eagleman/dp/0307377334">Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain</a>, by David Eagleman</strong><br />Perfect for the armchair neuroscientist, David Eagleman's captivating new book explains the innerworkings of the brain with a slant toward revealing the gajillion different subconscious processes that are happening all the time as we glide along blissfully unaware. (Unrelated: Eagleman's nonfiction work <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sum-Forty-Tales-Afterlives-Vintage/dp/0307389936/ref=bxgy_cc_b_img_b"><em>Sum</em></a> is also fantastic for gifting.)<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Malaria-Michael-Bungay-Stanier/dp/1936719282/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321919413&amp;sr=1-1">End Malaria</a>, edited by Michael Bungay Stanier</strong><br />A collection of essays about how and what it means to do great work, <em>End Malaria</em> is literally the feel-good productivity book of the year.

Linden</strong><br />Neuroscience professor David J. Linden digs into the mechanisms that drive us to seek out pleasure in this breezy read, analyzing the built-in "rewards systems" that make us love exercise, sex, drugs, learning, gambling, and more. At best, dipping into this book could help you figure out how to tweak your rewards systems for better idea execution; at worst, it might make you feel less guilty about procrastinating.<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Character-Strengths-Virtues-Handbook-Classification/dp/0195167015/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321919761&amp;sr=1-1">Character Strengths &amp; Virtues</a>, by C. Peterson &amp; M. Seligman</strong><br />How do we build character? And can it be learned? In this exhaustive text, Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman share insights into the 24 character strengths that span the ages - from Aristotle to the <em>Upanishads</em> - and look at strategies for cultivating them. Seeing if you can make it through this tome's 800 pages might be a revelation of character in and of itself!<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Adapt-Success-Always-Starts-Failure/dp/0374100969/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322002269&amp;sr=1-1-spell">Adapt: Why Success Always Starts With Failure</a>, by Tim Harford</strong><br />According to economist Tim Harford, the world has become so darn complex that we can no longer idly rely superiors or "experts" to show us how to solve our problems. Instead, we must tackle them ourselves and learn through good ol' trial-and-error. The upshot? It's time to become very, very comfortable with failure.

In <em>What Technology Wants</em>, he thoughtfully compares our technological development to the growth of a living organism - and one that has its own objectives at that. While the concept may sound ominous, the book is not. As one Amazon shopper noted: "The perfect read for any geek whose inner technophile is in constant battle with his inner Luddite."<br /><br /><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393072223">The Shallows</a>, by Nicholas Carr</strong><br />As Marshall McLuhan said, "We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us." Here, journalist Nicholas Carr - author of the infamous "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/">Is Google Making Us Stupid?</a>" article - digs into McLuhan's assertion, reflecting on how the Internet is literally changing the way our brains work. If you need an additional endorsement, <em>The Shallows</em> was a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction.</div>
